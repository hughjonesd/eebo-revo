            shewing the meanes whereby the same may speedily be done and that it rests in his maiesties sole power to effect it
            presented to the consideration of all those that loue the truth and peace by a friend and seruant to both
            
               the commons of england that great body consisting of more then ten millions of liuing soules hauing with great ioy and hope waited now full twenty moneths for the happie effects of this long desired parliament do now perceiue by his maiesties declarations to his parliament and his present proceedings in opposition to their councells they are like not only to be frustrated of those ioyes and hopes but to haue confusion and ruine immediately fall upon his maiesty themselues and this whole kingdome by ciuill discord whereof s liuing men they cannot but be sensible and hauing no better meanes of accesse to his maiesty are constrained in this common way to breath out their griefes and feares hoping in its passage abroad it may meet with some great man who in imitation of him that had compassion upon the multitude will conuey it into his maiesties royall hand of whose goodnesse his people haue had more then 16 yeares experience
            that by the wisdome and iustice of his maiesty the fidelity loyalty and duty of his parliament and the blessing of god upon both those uisible miseries hanging ouer this whole kingdome
may speedily be remoued and a happie and blessed concord renewed and continued betwixt his maiestie and his great councell the representatiue body of this kingdome
            the commons doe obserue that his maiesty in his declarations doth declare his intentions are not only to preserue his iust prerogatiue rights and priuiledges due to his crown but also to preserue his people and kingdome in peace and safety and that his subiects may also enioy their religion laws liberties rights and priuiledges due and belonging to them and their posterities
            they obserue likewise that the parliament in their remonstrances and declarations published to the whole world do professe the uery same thing to be their ends and intentions concerning his maiesty his people and kingdome for which his maiesties gratious expressions as they are bound to giue his maiesty most humble thanks so are they obliged in all duty and seruice to those noble gentlemen and others of their own chusing not only for their long continued and unwearied paines for the good of his maiesty and this whole kingdome but also for their fidelity wisdome and care so really expressed and performed in discharge of that great trust they haue committed to them being no lesse then al that they and their posterities haue or are and to be faithfull to them in obedience to all their lawfull commands tending to the good and safety of his maiesties royall person and his kingdome
            these being the mutuall and they hope reall intentions of his maiesty and his parliament concerning them thus concurring in one and published to the whole world so to be neuer say they was any kingdome neerer to confusion if not destruction under a coniuncture of so good intentions and what uipers or rather what deuils are there upon the earth that by wicked councell would diuide those intentions and bring desolation upon this whole kingdome and what torments lesse then hell doe such men merit but their hope and confidence is his maiesties own goodnesse and care of his people so often expressed and published to the world will be motiue sufficient to turne his eare from the councells of such wicked persons and to ioyne with his parliament in pursuit of those good intentions and not for such mens sakes to expose his own royall person to danger and his people and kingdome to ruine
            
            they further obserue that it pleaseth his maiesty in his declarations to charge the cause of all unhappy differences betwixt his maiesty and his parliament upon some few turbulent ambitious factious spirits in both houses of parliament members thereof whose cunning conueyance and carriage of busines in both houses for their own ambitious ends and aduantage haue procured so great a party in both houses that their uotes are become the parliament and these men it is saith his maiesty that make orders and ordinances displeasing to his maiestie being as his maiesty affirmeth against the established known laws of the land and his maiesties iust and royall prerogatiue warranted by those lawes
            they obserue also that the parliament declare the cause of those differences to be a wicked and pernitious councell about his maiesty who are seldome wanting about the throne of the best and most pious princes being either atheists papists and jesuites delinquents or men of desperate fortunes engaged only to their own ends though it proue the ruine both of king and kingdome and of necessity one of these two parties it must fall upon for his maiesties people doe well know the goodnesse of his own disposition and inclination to his subiects manifested out of his royall brest in the beginning of his reigne before this uiperous brood had time to take hold of him and call to mind his gracious expressions and actions towards his subiects in those times and also his maiesties frequent protestations and imprecations made this present parliament of his maiesties great care and good intentions to preserue his people in peace the true protestant religion the laws liberties and priuiledge of parliament from the least change or uiolation and therfore whatsoeuer the french histories haue recorded and published concerning congratulatory letters passed betwixt his maiesty and the pope of rome at his maiesties being in spaine they dare not admit the least thought of change or alteration to be in his maiesties own brest but must cast it upon one of the parties afore named
            and therfore for appeasing all differences and preuention of all dangers ready to fall upon his maiestie and this whole kingdome his people doe most humbly desire his maiesty to doe himselfe and his kingdome that right and iustice which lies in his owne power to doe by naming such persons if any such be members of
both or either houses of parliament as his maiesty is informed are the men who draw all this feare of miserie on his maiesty and his kingdome that they may come to tryall before the parliament in a parliamentary way and there receiue iudgement and punishment if they shalbe found guilty or otherwise their accusers who haue so highly wronged his maiesty his parliament and people may come to like tryall and receiue such punishment as the iustice of that court shall inflict upon them
            and for the same reasons they would also most humbly beseech his maiesty to name unto his parliament those persons neer about his maiesty who haue been or are his maiesties councellors in expounding of laws framing making and penning of declarations proclamations messages and passages betwixt his maiesty and his parliament for his maiesty best knows who those men are and deliuer them to the parliament to iustifie their doings which as it will most magnifie the honour of his maiesty to the loue of truth and iustice so will it be the clearest manifestation his maiesty can giue of the reallity of his royall intention to his people and lay the greatest obligation of duty loue and obedience upon them and all good subiects that his marestie can expect from a loyall and true hearted people which untill his maiesty grant their feares will keep them restlesse
            these most humble desires the commons conceiue to be so iust equall seasonable and fuitable to his maiesties gracious disposition that in honour and iustice he will not deny them to his people being as they think the most hopefull meanes under heauen to secure his maiesty  his people from the approaching dangers and miseries of a bloody warre and to settle a firme and lasting peace between his maiesty his parliament and people which is that his maiesty hath so often taken the almighty god to witnesse is the thing he so much desires wherein the commons are confident and will expect that the lords and others of his maiesties most honourable priuie councell and all the peers of this realme and others attending his maiesty who desire the safety peace and prosperity of his maiesty his people and kingdoms wil ioyn with them and according to their relations offices places neernesse and credit with his maiesty will put forth their uttermost strength counsells and indeauours to preferre and accomplish these their humble dsires to his maiesty otherwise they must think as they may haue iust
cause they are of the malignant party more willing to behold all of them and this whole kingdome streaming in blood then relinquish their owne pernitious councels and ends and be ready to execute the commands of the parliament against them
            the differences themselues between his maiesty and his parliament in his maiesties declarations appeare to be foure first detaining his towne and magazine of hull secondly remouing the magazine and armes thence to other places and the like in other parts of the kingdome thirdly putting the militia in execution contrary to his maiesties proclamation fourthly making of leauies and raising of men horse and money and these all done by orders and ordinances of parliament and as his maiesties declaration saith against his maiesties pleasure because it is against the law and his maiesties prerogatiue warranted by the law
            the only question then is whether these proceedings by both houses of parliament in this time of danger his maiestie hauing refused to ioyne with them be against the fundamentall lawes of the land and his maiesties prerogatiue warranted by those lawes and aboue the power and priuiledge of parliament to meddle in for the safety of his maiesties royall person his kingdome and people
            the commons doe all know his maiestie to be no expounder of lawes for so his maiestie is pleased to professe as belonging neither to his person nor office but therein to be guided by the iudgement and councells of others to whom his maiestie doth commit that trust to giue right iudgement betwixt his maiestie and people and what councellors his maiesty hath had and what expositions of laws and statutes haue been made during this present parliament and how iniuriously his maiesty his parliament and people haue been dealt with therein is like to appeare in the kingdomes confusion if his maiesties goodnesse and wisdome in casting off such councells and speedy ioyning with his parliament preuent it not
            and what seruice such euill councellors haue done to this kingdome in former ime and what exposition of laws they haue made let the petition of right granted by his maiestie to all his subiects in ease of their grieuances witnesse
            and what councells they haue giuen and exposstion of laws
they haue made ssnce that petition granted let ship money coat and coauct money and many other uniust and illegall impositions layed upon his maiesties subiects and declared in the parliaments remonstrances witnesse also and into what condition such pernitious councells and councellors haue brought this kingdome and his maiesties kingdome of ireland at this present let the consuming flames in the one and the kindled fire in the other testifie
            the parliament the commons doe know and their councells uotes ordinances expositions and declarations to his maiestie and his people they heare and see attested under the authority of one or both houses and therefore are bound in reason and duty to beleeue their proceedings are warranted by the fundamentall laws of the land and are according to the power and priuiledge of parliament untill the like or better authority appeare to the contrary for those who expound the laws to his maiesty and are his counsellors they know not their persons or names neither see their hands attesting the counsels they giue nor expositions they make which makes them suspect they are men of darknesse and such as flee from the light of parliament wherefore it is the most humble desire of all his maiesties good subiects that his maiestie will put no longer confidence in their councels or expositions of laws but hearken to the aduise of his great councell the parliament
            and whether it bee more meet safe iust and honourable for his maiestie and his subiects to put confidence in the councells and iudgements of such councellors and the exposition they make of lawes and the power and priuiledges of parliament or in the parliament themselues being the great counsell of the kingdome and the makers of all laws the commons beseech his maiestie and all the world to iudge
            as it is farre from the heart of euery good subiect to diminish the least part of his maiesties royall prerogatiue due by the laws and statutes of the realme being part of the inheritance of his crowne and descended to his maiestie from his royall progenitors kings of this realme so are all subiects bound to maintain the liberties rights and priuiledges due and belonging to the parliament and people of england and the lawes that defend and preserue the same the one as being the iust and undoubted inheritance of his maiestie the other as their inheritance as iust and undoubtedly due to themselues  their posterities granted to their predecessors
more then fiue hundred years past conrfimed to their ancestors in all ages and not questioned or attempted to be uiolated untill of late by the wicked councell and fraud of ill ministers and councellors who for their owne ends and to obtain the fauour of princes haue taken upon them the boldnesse to aduance the prerogatiue aboue law and endeauoured to bring the lawes and the power and priuiledges of parliament to such construction themselues would make thereby at once breaking in upon the priuiledges of parliament and the inheritance of the subiect and so by pretence of law to root up the foundation of law the parliament it selfe
            the commons do therefore most humbly beseech his maiestie that the distractions griefes and feares of so many thousand thousands of his loyall subiects layed before his maiesty in this time of danger may preuaile with his maiesty speedily to return to his parliament and there in the way of iustice to examine all misinformations his maiesty hath had both of persons and causes and let all offenders whatsoeuer tast the seuerity of his maiesties iustice who haue been counsellors instruments or actors to make so great a breach betwixt his maiestie and his parliament and put his kingdome and people into so much danger and so many losses in their estates by the long decay of their trading in all parts caused by those diuisions
            for the tumults which his maiesty seemeth to flee from the commons doubt not his maiestie will find his parliament and all good subiects most willing to suppresse and punish all unlawfull tumults and disorders caused by any persons whatsoeuer when it shall please his maiesty to ioyne with his parliament in securing this and his other kingdomes from the plots and designes of jesuites papists and other instruments of theirs whose worke it is now to disturbe the peace of his maiesties dominions for preseruation of their spanish monarchy and popish tyranny by suppressing or destroying of prince parliament and people that stand in their way for the commons would that all the world should know they are english protestants whose religion is not founded either upon superstirious uanities or schismaticall fancies but upon the reuealed will and well warranted word of god consonant to the sound and orthodoxe doctrine of the church of england whereunto they will allwayes submit prouided it may be purged
from what giues iust occasion of scandall or offence and not so mixed or adorned with rights and ceremonies that whilest the body is drest the soule of religion which is life and power should be lost for god is a spirit and will be worshiped in spirit and in truth which is the freedome they aske without which the protestant religion is but protestant profession will make men but seeming saints while deuils and set them but half the way to heauen
            
               and if his majestie shall not be pleased to hearken to these most humble desires of his people and make some present returne for putting out those fires now kindled in this kingdome the wofull spectacle of their poore brethren in ireland will cause them all that are able to joyne with his parliament in obedience to their commands for the preseruation of his majesty his kingdome and themselues from utter ruine nature it selfe hauing taught beasts when stormes are rising to prouide for their owne safetie but in hope of his maiesties gracious answer they will waite and pray for the long life and happie and peaceable reigne of his majestie
