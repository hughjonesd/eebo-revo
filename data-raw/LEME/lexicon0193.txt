was knight of the <f type="i">Bath,<f type="r"> and Lord of <f type="i">Verolane,<f type="r"> nowe called

and <f type="i">Oesa<f type="r"> taking it for their refuge, were besieged by <f type="i">Vther 
Pendragon,<f type="r">, who brake the walles and defaced it. After this, by 
litle and litle it languished, so that it became a deane or harbour 
of theeues and harlots vntill King <f type="i">Offa,<f type="r"> about the yeare of our 
Lord 793 builded an Abbey in honor of S. <f type="i">Albon,<f type="r"> in a place

<f type="i">Albons<f type="r"> flourished. And <f type="i">Alfricke<f type="r"> the seuenth Abbot of the house, 
bought the fishing pond of the King: and for that the Fisher&shy;
men dayly endomaged the religious people, it was with great
cost drayned, &amp; made drie. There remaineth at this day a street 
in S. <f type="i">Albons,<f type="r"> called Fishpoole street: and for that there hath  	 	
bene found about the Citie, Anchors, keles of beates, old nailes

that way, which errour grewe by corruption of <f type="i">Gyldas<f type="r"> booke,

heare what ancient recordes doo testifie concerning the same.

   In the time of King <f type="i">Edgar,<f type="r"> when <f type="i">Aegelred<f type="r"> was Abbot, he 
caused the ruines of <f type="i">Verolane<f type="r"> to be searched, the vaultes to bee 
vncouered, and the pauements to be digged vp: where he found 
Pillers, peeces of antique worke, thresholds, door-frames, pil&shy;
lers for windowes of fine masonrie worke, some of Porphyrie, 
some Touch, some Alablaster, all which were verie conuenient 
for his purpose: besides, hee found sockets of Lattyn, and of
brasse, with diuers other thinges which hee reserued towardes
the foundation of a new abbey, which he intended to build. But
being preuented by death, <f type="i">Edmerus<f type="r"> his successor digged a&shy;
gaine, and found Idols, Altars richly couered, Iugs and cruses
with pots, some of wood, some stone, and some gold, artificially
wrought and carued. And proceeding farther, hee found pots of 
gold, siluer, and some of brasse, some with coyne, and some with 
bones and ashes of such as haue bene burned or buried: all 
which were reserued, and the mettels melted, and kept for this
