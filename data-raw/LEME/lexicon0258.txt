<expression lang="la">Sestertium</expression> in the neuter gender, betokeneth

sterces, so that <expression lang="la">decem Sestertia</expression> signifieth tenne
thousand Sestertij, and <expression lang="la">decem Sestertium</expression> is
as much: for you must in this manner of
speech understand <expression lang="la">millia</expression> for the <f type="i">regimen</f> of
the Genitive case. But if you adde unto
<expression lang="la">Sestertium</expression> the numerall adverbe, it sheweth
the same <expression lang="la">Sestertium</expression> in the neutre above said,
multiplied a hundred times so much as the
said numerall beareth. For example, <expression lang="la">decies
Sestertium</expression>, is <expression lang="la">decem Sestertium</expression>, a hundred times
told, and as much to say as <expression lang="la">decies centena mil&shy;
lia Sestertium</expression>, which is a million of Sester&shy;
ces in the primitive signification: whereby a
man may soone reckon how much is <expression lang="la">millies
Sestertium</expression> and the rest, either under or over
<expression lang="la">decies</expression>. The same is to bee said of <expression lang="la">Numus</expression> and

<expression lang="la">Sestertium</expression>. Moreover, <expression lang="la">decies</expression>, <expression lang="la">millies</expression>, and such
like adverbes, whether you put <expression lang="la">Numum</expression> or 
<expression lang="la">Sestertium</expression> thereto, or no, is all one: so that
by this forme of speaking, <expression lang="la">ejus bona fuerunt

unto two millions of Sesterce peeces. Thus
much for Livie and other Historians and wri&shy;
