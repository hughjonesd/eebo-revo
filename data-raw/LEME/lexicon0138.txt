<heading>Of the Termes of Venerie.</heading>

I Haue thought meete to write a briefe note or 
abstracte of such termes &#38; proper woordes as I 
haue obserued in Venerie, either by reading or 
by experience: aswell bycause mine Aucthor 
hath done the like, as also bicause I finde it very 
pertinent to the purpose. But bicause I find that 
his termes in the Frenche are in many places much different fr<expan type="">om</expan> 
ours (&#38; yet many holde opinion that we borowed all our termes 
of Hunting, Hawking, and such like out of the Frenche) therfore 
I haue thought my parte to set downe suche as I my selfe haue 
eyther herd pronounced by olde Huntesmen, or founde approued 
in olde Trystrams booke. And if the Reader do finde that in any
parte of the discourses in this booke, I haue termed any of them
otherwise, then let him also consider that in handling of an Arte, 
or in setting downe rules and precepts of any thing, a man
must vse suche woordes as may be most easie, perspicuous and in&#173;
telligible. But here (as neare as I can) I will set them downe 
in suche termes as wee ought by lawe of Venerie to name 
them: as followeth.

An Heard of Raynedeare. Trystr<expan type="">am</expan> addeth, A Richesse of Mar&#173;

as also a brase of Harts or Hindes, Buckes or Does, is very pro&#173;
perly spoken: but more than two or three Hares, you shal seldom
see togither at once. Twoo Conies are called a couple, and three 
are called a couple &#38; a halfe of Conies. If they be many feeding 
out togethers, we say it is a fayre game of Conies. As for Fox, 
Badgerd &#38; other suche vermine, you shall seldome see more than 
one of them at once, vnlesse it be when they engendre: and then 
their encrease is called A lytter. This is asmuche as I thinke

mouth, we saye that he is embost. And when he holdeth out his 
necke, we say he is spent or done. And when he is deade, we 
saye that he is downe. The rewarde to the houndes, is called a
Rewarde or quarrey.</form><xpln></xpln></wordentry>

houndes for any chase, it is called drawing of the Couert.
When they cast about a groue or wood with their Liamhound,
then they make a ryng. When they finde where a Deare hath
passed, and breake or plashe any boughe downewardes for a
marke, then we saye, they blemishe, or make blemishes. When 
they hang vppe any paper, clout, or other marke, then it is to be 
called Sewelling or setting of Sewels. When they set houndes in a
readynesse whereas they thinke a chase will passe, and cast them 
off before the rest of the kennell come in, it is called a vaunt laye.

When they tarrie till the rest of the kennell come in, and then 
cast off, it is called an Allay. But when they hold vntill the ken&#173;
nell be past them, then it is called a Relay. When a hounde mee&#173;
teth a chase, and goeth away with it farre before the rest, then we 
say he foreloyneth. When a hounde hunteth backwardes the same 
way that the chase is come, then we say he hunteth Counter. And 
if he hunt any other chase than that which he first vndertooke, we
say he hunteth change. When eyther Hare or Deare, or any o&#173;
chase vseth subtleties to deceyue the houndes, we saye they
crosse or double. The rewarde at death of any beast of Venerie, 
is called the quarry or rewarde. But of all other chases, it is to be
called the hallowe. And this is as much as I can presently call to 
remembraunce, eyther by reading or experience, touching the 
termes of Venerie. Wherein I desire all such as are skilfull, 
to beare with my boldnesse: promising that if any thing 
be amysse, it shall (God willing) be amended 
at the nexte impression, if I 
lyue so long.</form><xpln></xpln></wordentry>
