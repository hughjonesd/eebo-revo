<wordgroup1 type="a" object="A"><alpha>A</alpha>
<wordentry type="h"><form lang="en">ANgle,</form> <xpln lang="en"> Is a Geometricall terms for a Corner, included
by two lines, of which there are three sorts; to wit,
<f type="r">A Right, An Acute</f>, and <f type="r">An Obtuse Angel</f>.
<subform lang="en">1. A Right angle,</subform> <subxpln lang="en">Is when the two lines meeting doe
frame a just square Angle of 90. Degrees.</subxpln>
<subform lang="en">2. An Acute,</subform> <subxpln lang="en">Is when the two lines doe enclose lesse then a
Square, thereby becoming more sharpe, and therefore
<f type="r">Acute</f>, from the Latine word <term lang="la"><f type="r">Acutus</f></term>, sharpe.</subxpln>
<subform lang="en">3. An Obtuse Angle,</subform> <subxpln lang="en">Is when the two lines doe include
more then the Square, making it thereby the more blunt
and dull, and is therefore called <f type="r">Obtuse</f>, from <term lang="la"><f type="r">Obtusus</f></term>,
which is Latine for blunt, or dull.</subxpln></xpln></wordentry>

<wordentry type="h"><form lang="en">Astragall,</form> <xpln lang="en">Is a term of Architecture, and is (according to
<f type="r">Vitruvius</f>, an ancient and famous Author thereof) a
ring to deck or adorn the neck of a Columne; and is there&shy;
fore transferred to Cannon, agreeing somewhat in
shape with the Columne, or Pillar.</xpln></wordentry>

<wordentry type="h"><form lang="en">Avenue,</form> <xpln lang="en" lexeme="barricado(n)">Comes of the French, and is the space that is left

or first invention of any thing: and is to be pronounced,
as if it were written <term lang="it"><f type="r">Capritchio</f></term>.</xpln>
<lemenote>
This use of "Capriccio" antedates the earliest OED quotation in this sense (3; 1678).

<wordentry type="h"><form lang="en">Degrees,</form> <xpln lang="en">A degree according to the Mathematicks is 
the 360. part of the circumference of the world. And
consequently of any Circle; for <f type="r">Euclide</f> affirms all Cir&shy;
cles to be equall. So that the Circle so divided, (to wit,
into 360. parts) being cut at right Angles in the Center,
each Quadrant thereof shall be of 90. Degrees.
Note,
That all Calculations for the Degrees of Angles have re&shy;
ference to a Circle so divided.</xpln></wordentry>

<wordgroup1 type="a" object="G"><alpha>G</alpha>
<wordentry type="h"><form lang="en">GEometry,</form> <xpln lang="en">As <f type="r">Adrianus Metius</f> defines it, is th<emend err="s">e</emend>
Art of measuring well.
Now to give you somewhat more satisfaction herein, I
will a little enlarge this definition, being assured that it can&shy;
not be lost labour for any who desires to peruse this Booke.
<subform lang="en">1. To measure well,</subform> <subxpln lang="en">is to interpret, and exercise the measu&shy;
rable nature, power, propriety, state, and use of any thing.</subxpln>
<subform lang="en">2. The subject of Geometry</subform> <subxpln lang="en">is Magnitude, and Mag&shy;
nitude is a continued quantity, whose parts agree to a common
terme, but a terme is the extreame of magnitude.</subxpln>
<subform lang="en">3. Magnitude,</subform> <subxpln lang="en">is either a line, or a lined figure.</subxpln>
<subform lang="en">A line,</subform> <subxpln lang="en">is onely magnitude in length.</subxpln>
<subform lang="en">A lined figure</subform> <subxpln lang="en">is made out of lines composed; or as <f type="r">Ramus</f>
defines it,
A lined Figure, is more then Magnitude in length, and is
either a Superficies, or a Body.</subxpln>
<subform lang="en">A <f type="r">Superficies</f>,</subform> <subxpln lang="en">Is onely the surface of a lined figure of length
and breadth.</subxpln>
</page>

<page sig="f2v">
<subform lang="en">A Body,</subform> <subxpln lang="en">Is a Figure consisting of length, breadth, and
depth.</subxpln>
The first part therefore of measure, is to be understood of
lines.
The second of Superficies.
But the third, of Bodies.
  So much shall suffice to explaine what Geometry is,
but to shew amply its extent and power, requires a
greater writer and volume.</xpln></wordentry>

<wordentry type="h"><form lang="en">Irregular,</form> <xpln lang="en">Is a disagreeing of the one side, (or more) to the
rest of the Figure, which causeth also an incoherence a&shy;
mongst the Angles: wherefore any Figure whose An&shy;
gles and sides doth disagree in dimension, is called an
irregular Figure.</xpln></wordentry>

<subform lang="en">6. And lastly, <f type="r">Dupla</f>,</subform> <subxpln lang="en">which is a double square.</subxpln>

quiquarta, Diagonea, Superbitiens tertias</f>, and the
