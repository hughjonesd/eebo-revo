That no nation of the Indies hath beene found to have
had the vse of letters. CHAP 4.

<wordentry type="d">
<form lexeme="letter(n)">LEtters</form> <xpln lexeme="word(n)" lexeme="sign(n)" lexeme="mark(n)" lexeme="cipher(n)">were invented to signifie properly the words
we do pronounce, even as woordes (according to 
the Philosopher) are the signes and demonstrations of 
mans thoughtes and conceptions. And both the one 
and the other (I say the letters and words) were ordai&shy;
ned to make things knowne. The voyce for such as are 
present, and letters for the absent, and such as are to
come. Signes and markes which are not properly to
signifie wordes, but things, cannot be called, neyther 
in trueth are they letters, although they be written, for
wee can not say that the Picture of the sunne be a wri&shy;
ting of the sunne, but onely a picture; the like may be
saide of other signes and characters, which have no re&shy;
semblance to the thing, but serve onely for memorie;
for he that invented them, did not ordaine them to sig&shy;
nifie wordes, but onely to note the thing: neyther do
they call those characters, letters, or writings, as indeede
they are not, but rather ciphers, or remembraunces, as
those be which the Spherists or Astronomers do vse,
to signifie divers signes or planets of <f type="I"/>Mars, Venus, Iupi&shy;
ter, &amp;c.<f type="r"/> 

Such characters are ciphers, and no letters: for what
name soever <f type="I"/>Mars<f type="r"/> may have in Italian, French, or Spa&shy;
nish, this character doth alwaies signifie it, the which is
not found in letters: for althogh they <emend err="siguify">signify</emend> the thing,
yet is it by meanes of words.</xpln>
