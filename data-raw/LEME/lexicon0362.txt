Great LORDS, 
IUlius C&aelig;sar wrote his 
owne Commentaries, 
holding it no lesse 
honour to write, than 
fight; much hath bin 
writ concerning the 
art of war by land, yet 
nothing concerning 
the same at Sea. Many others might better 
than my selfe haue done this, but since I 
found none endeuourd it, I haue aduentured, 
encouraged by the good entertainment of 
</page>

<page sig="a2v">
my late printed Accidence. This I suppose 
will be much bettered by men in these things 
better experienced, others ignorance may 
fault it: I haue beene a miserable Practitioner 
in this Schoole of Warre by Sea and Land 
more than thirty yeeres, howeuer chance or 
occasion haue kept me from your Lordships 
knowledge or imployment. Yet I humbly 
entreat your Lordships to accept and patro&shy;
nize this little Pamphlet, as the best testimony 
I can present your Honours, of my true duty 
to my King and Country. Thus humbly 
crauing your Honours pardons, and favou&shy;

Your Honours in all duty 
to be commanded,

Honest Readers,
IF my desire to doe good hath trans&shy;
ported mee beyond my selfe, I 
intreat you excuse me, and take 
for requitall this rude bundle of 
many ages observations; al&shy;
though they be not so punctually compiled as I 
could wish, and it may bee you expect; At this 
present I cannot much amend them; if any will 
bestow that paines, I shall thinke him my friend,

REader within this little worke thou hast 
The view of things present, to come, and past, 
Of consequence and benefit to such 
As know but little, thinking they know much; 
And in thy quiet chamber safely read, 
Th' experience of the liuing and the dead, 
Who with great paine and perill oft haue tride 
When they on angry Neptunes backe did ride.

To hoise them vp and throw them downe againe.

I Hate to flatter thee, but in my heart

Much praise and honor, both from Truth and Fame. 
What Iudge so e're thy Actions ouer-looke, 
Thou need'st not feare a triall by thy Booke.

THe Lighter Hippias of Troy disclos'd, 
Germans in India Cannowes now in trade, 
The Barge by grave Amocles was compos'd, 
The Argozees first the Illyrians made, 
	The Galley Iason built that Gracian sparke, 
	The Cyprians first did crosse the Seas with Barke. 

The Keele by the Ph&aelig;nicians first was nam'd, 
The Tyrrhens first made anchors, Plateans oares; 
The Rhodians for the Brigandine are fam'd, 
Cyrenians found the Craer, and Creet adores 
	D&aelig;da<expan type="l'">lus</expan> for Masts, and Saile-yards; Typhis wise 
	(With triple honour) did the sterne deuise. 

The Tackle famous Anacharsis wrought, 
Noble Pyseus did the Stem first frame, 
To light the Copians first the Rudder brought, 
Toung Icarus for Sailes acquir'd great fame, 
	Thou, with the best of these mai'st glory share, 
	That hast deuis'd, compil'd a worke so rare. 

For what long trauels observations true 
On Seas,( where waues doe seeme to wash the skies) 
Have made thee know, thou (willing) do'st vnscrew 
To those that want like knowledge; each man cries 
	Live worthy Smith; England for this endeuour 
	Will (if not stupid) give thee thanks for euer.

MOney, the worlds soule, that both formes and fames her, 
Is her bad Genius to, it damnes, and shames her. 
If merit and desert were truly weighed 
	In iustice Scales, not all by money swey'd; 
Smith should not want reward, with many moe, 
	Whom sad oblivion now doth ouer-flow. 
For now no good things gotten without money, 
	Except tis got, as Beares from thornes licke honey, 
With danger to themselues. For poore mens words 
	Are wind, and aire: Great mens are pickes, and swords. 
Greatnesse more safe may act lust, theft, or treason, 
	Than poore Iohn Smith or I may steale two peason, 
Or drinke a harmelesse cup, to chase away 
	Sad cares and griefes that haunt vs euery day. 
Who saw thy Virgin limbd by thee so truly, 
	Would sweare thou hadst beene one that sawest her newly, 
One of her latest louers. But to tell 
	The truth, I thinke they know her not so well. 
And this Sea Grammar learn'd long since by thee, 
	Thou now hast form'd so artificiallie, 
That many a beardlesse boy, and Artlesse foole, 
	Preferr'd before thee, may come to thy schoole.

TO HIS FRIEND 
Captaine Smith, on his 
Grammar.
</heading> 
 
MUch traueld Captaine, I haue heard thy worth 
By Indians, in America set forth: 
Mee silence best seemes to keepe, and then 
Thy better praise be sung by better men, 
Who feele thy vertues worthinesse: Who can 
Deriue thy words, is more Grammarian, 
Than Camden, Clenard, Ramus, Lilly were; 
Here's language would haue non-plust Scaliger. 
These and thy trauels may in time be seene 
By those which stand at Helme, and prime ones beene.

To expresse themselues, calld Technologicall. 
Logicke doth teach what Pradicables bee, 
Genus and Species, * with the other three. 
Philosophie, purblind in the first Creation, 
Talks of first Matters forme, and void Priuation. 
Geographie teaches how for to define 
Tropicks, Meridians, and the Equators line. 
So words of Art belong to Navigation 
And ships, which here from thee receiue translation; 
That now th' vntraueld land-man may with ease 
Here know the language both of ships and Seas. 
I haue no Art of words due praise to impart 
To thee that thus expound'st these words of Art.

THou which in Sea-learning would'st Clerk commence, 
First learne to reade, and after reade to learne, 
For words to sound, and not to know their sense, 
Is for to saile a ship without a Sterne. 
By this Sea Grammar thou mayst distinguish 
And vnderstand the Lattine by the English. 

Here mayst thou learne the names of all ships geere, 
And with their names, their natures, and their vse; 
To hoise the Sailes, and at the Helme to steere; 
To know each Shroud, each Rope, each Knot, each Noose, 
And by their names to call them euery one, 
'Tis such a Booke as may be call'd Such none. 

And yet a Smith thereof the Authour is, 
And from his Forge alone we haue the same, 
Who, for his skill in such a worke as this, 
Doth farre excell all others of his name:
He's neither Lock-Smith, Gold-Smith, nor Black-Smith, 
But (to give him his right name) he's Iack-Smith.

so swiftly presseth the water, as that it foameth, and in the

As touching the reasons of ebbes and floods, and to know 
how far it is to the bottome of the deepest place of the Sea, I 
will not take vpon me to discourse of; as knowing the same 
to be the secrets of God vnreuealed to man: only I will set 
downe a Philosophicall speculation of diuers mens opini&shy;
ons touching the depth of the Sea; which I hope will not 
be thought much impertinent to the subiect of this booke 
by the iudicious Reader. 

<heading>The height of
mountaines per&shy;
pendicular.</heading>
Fabianus in Plinie, and Cleomides conceiued the depth 
of the Sea to be fifteene furlongs, that is, a mile and 7/8 parts, 
Plutarch compared it equall to the highest mountaines, 
Scallinger and others conceited the hils farre surpassed the 
deepnesse of the Sea, and that in few places it is more 
than a hundered paces in depth, it may bee hee meant 
in some narrow Seas, but in the maine Ocean experi&shy;
ence hath taught vs it is much more than twice so much, 
for I haue sounded 300. fadome, yet found no ground. 
Eratosthenes in Theon that great Mathematitian writeth the 
highest mountain perpendicular is but ten furlongs, that is, 
one mile and a quarter. Also Dic&aelig;arcus affirmeth this to be 
the height of the hill Pelius in Thessalia, but Xenagoras in 
Plutarch obserued the height of Olimpus in the same region 
to be twenty paces more, which is 1270. paces, but surely 
all those meane onely those mountaines in or about Greece 
where they liued and were best acquainted; but how these 
may compare with the Alps in Asia, Atlas in Africa, Cau&shy;
casus in India, the Andes in Peru, and diuers others hath 
not yet beene examined.
</page>

<page no="49">
<heading>The height of the
hils compared 
with the superfi&shy;
cies of the earth
and depth of the
Sea.</heading>
But whatsoeuer the hils may be aboue the superficies of 
the earth, many hold opinion the Sea is much deeper, 
who suppose that the earth at the first framing was in the 
superficies regular and sphericall, as the holy Scriptures di&shy;
rects vs to beleeue; because the water couered and com&shy;
passed all the face of the earth, also that the face of the 
earth was equall to that of the Sea. Damascen noteth, that 
the vneuennesse and irregularity which now is seene in the 
earths superficies, was caused by taking some parts out of 
the vpper face of the earth in sundry places to make it more 
hollow, and lay them in other places to make it more con&shy;
uex, or by raising vp some part and depressing others to 
make roome and receit for the Sea, that mutation being 
wrought by the power of the word of the Lord, Let the 
waters be gathered into one place that the dry land may ap&shy;
peare. As for Aquinas, Dionysius, Catharianus, and some 
Diuines that conceited there was no mutation, but a vio&shy;
lent accumulation of the waters, or heaping them vp on 
high is vnreasonable; because it is against nature, that wa&shy;
ter being a flexible and a ponderous body, so to consist and 
stay it selfe, and not fall to the lower parts about it; where 
in nature there is nothing to hinder it, or, if it be restrained 
supernaturally by the hand and bridle of Almighty God, 
lest it should ouer-whelme and drowne all the land, it 
must follow, that God euen in the very institution of na&shy;
ture imposed a perpetuall violence vpon nature. And this 
with all, that at the Deluge there was no necessity to breake 
vp the springs of the deepe and to open the cattaracts of 
Heauen, and powre downe water continually so many 
daies and nights together, seeing the only with-drawing of 
that hand, or letting goe of that bridle which restraineth the 
water would presently haue ouerwhelmed all.

<heading>How all the hils
and dry land a&shy;
boue the superfi&shy;
cies of the Sea
hath made roome
for the Sea,
therefore they
are in equall
height &amp; depth.</heading>
But both by Scriptures, the experience of Nauigators, 
and reason in making estimation of the depth of the Sea, 
reckon not onely the height of the hils aboue the common 
superficies of the earth, but the height of all the dry land 
aboue the superficies of the Sea, because the whole masse 
</page>

<page no="49">
of earth that now appeareth aboue the waters, being taken 
as it were out of the places which the waters now possesse, 
must be equall to the place out of which it was taken; so 
consequently it seemeth, that the height or eleuation of the 
one should answer the descending or depth of the other; 
and therefore in estimating the depth of the Sea, wee consi&shy;
der not onely the erection of the hils aboue the ordinary 
land, but the aduantage of the dry land aboue the Sea; 
which latter, I meane the height of the ordinary maine 
land, excluding the hils, which properly answer the extra&shy;
ordinary deepes and whirle-pooles in the Sea. The rest is 
held more in large Continents aboue the Sea, than that of 
the hils is aboue the land.

<heading>That there is
small difference
betwixt the
springs first ri&shy;
sing out of the 
earth, and their
falling into the
Sea.</heading>
For that the plain face of the dry land is not leuel, or equal&shy;
ly distant from the Center, but hath a great descent towards 
the Sea, and a rising towards the mid-land parts, although 
it appeare not plainly to the eye, yet to reason it is most ma&shy;
nifest; because we find that part of the earth the Sea couereth 
descendeth lower and lower towards the Sea. For the Sea, 
which touching the vpper face of it, is knowne by nature to 
be leuell and euenly distant from the center, is obserued to 
wax deeper and deeper the further one saileth from the shore 
towards the maine Ocean: euen so in that part which is vn&shy;
couered, the streamings of Riuers on all sides from the mid&shy;
land parts towards the Sea, sliding from the higher to the 
lower declareth so much, whose courses are some 1000. or 
2000. miles, in which declination, Pliny in his deriuation 
of water requireth one cubit of declining in 240. foot of 
proceeding. But Columella, Viturnius, Paladius, and others, 
in their conduction of waters require somewhat lesse; 
namely, that in the proceeding of 200. foot forward, there 
should bee allowed one foot of descending downeward, 
which yet in the course of 1000. miles, as Danubius, Vol&shy;
gha, or Indus, &amp;c. haue so much or more, which will make 
five miles of descent in perpendicular account, and in the 
course of 2000. or more, as Nilus, Niger, and the Ri&shy;
uer of the Amazons haue 10. miles or more of the like 
descent.
</page>

<page no="50"
<heading>The determina&shy;
tion of these
questions.</heading>
These are not taken as rules of necessity, as though water 
could not runne without that aduantage, for that respect 
the conueyers of waters in these times content themselues 
with one inch in 600. foot, as Philander and Viturnius ob&shy;
serued, but is rather vnder a rule of commodity for expe&shy;
dition and wholsomnesse of water so conueyed, lest re&shy;
sting too long in pipes it should contract some vnwhol&shy;
some condition, or else through the slacknesse of motion, 
or long closenesse, or banishment from the aire, gather 
some aptnesse and disposition to putrifie. Although I say, 
such excesse of aduantage as in the artificiall conueyance of 
waters the forenamed Authors require, be not of necessity 
exacted in the naturall deriuation of them, yet certaine it 
is, that the descent of riuers being continually and their 
course long, and in many places swift, and in some places 
headlong and furious;

<heading>Note the diffe&shy;
rence betwixt 
the springs of the 
riuers and their
falling into the
Sea is not great.</heading>
the differences of height or aduan&shy;
tage cannot be great betwixt the springs of the riuers and 
their out lets, betwixt the first rising out of the earth and 
their falling into the Sea: vnto which declinity of land see&shy;
ing the deepenesse of the Sea in proportion answer as I 
before declared, and not onely to the height of the hils: it 
is concluded, that the deepenesse to bee much more than 
the Philosophers commonly reputed: and although the 
deepnesse of the Sardinian Sea, which Aristotle saith, was 
the deepest of the Mediterranean, recorded by Posidonius 
in Strabo, to haue beene found but 1000. fadome, which 
is but a mile and a fifth part, and the greatest breath not 
past 600. miles: then seeing if in so narrow a Sea it be so 
deepe, what may we esteeme the maine Ocean to be, that 
in many places is fiue times so broad, seeing the broader the 
Seas are, if they be intire and free from Ilands, they are an&shy;
swerably obserued to be the deeper. If you desire any fur&shy;
ther satisfaction, reade the first part of Purchas his Pilgri&shy;
mage, where you may reade how to find all those Authors 
at larger Now because he hath taken neere 100. times as

Considerations for a Sea Captaine in the choise of

giuing Chase, Boording, and entering a man

</heading>

<wordgroup1 type="t" object="Considerations for a Sea Captain">
<heading>How to chuse a
Ship fit to make
a man of warre.</heading>
IN Land seruice we call a man of warre a 
Souldier either on foot or horse, and 
at Sea a Ship, which if she be not as well 
built, conditioned, and prouided, as 
neere fitting such an imploiment as may 
be, she may proue (either) as a horseman 
that knoweth not how to hold his 
raines, keepe his seat in his saddle and stirrops, carry his bo&shy;
dy, nor how to helpe his horse with leg and spur in a curuet, 
gallop, or stop; or as an excellent horseman that knoweth 
all this, mounted vpon a Iade that will doe nothing, which 
were he mounted according to his experience, hee would 
doe more with that one, than halfe a dozen of the other 
though as well prouided as himselfe. But I confesse, euery 
horseman cannot mount himself alike, neither euery Seaman 
ship himselfe as he would, I meane not for outward orna&shy;
ment, which the better they are, the lesse to be disliked; for 
there cannot be a brauer sight than a ship in her brauery, but 
of a competent sufficiency as the businesse requireth. But 
were I to chuse a ship for my self, I would haue her saile well, 
yet strongly built, her decks flush and flat, and so roomy that 
men might passe with ease; her Bow and chase so Gally-like 
contriued, should beare as many Ordnances as with conue&shy;
niency she could, for that alwaies commeth most to fight,
</page>
 
<page no="56">
and so stiffe, she should beare a stiffe saile and beare out her 
lower tier in any reasonable weather, neither should her 
Gunroome be vnprouided: not manned like a Merchant&shy;
man, which if they be double manned, that is, to haue twise 
so many men as would saile her, they think it is too many in 
regard of the charge, yet to speake true, there is few Mer&shy;
chant Ships in the world doth any way exceed ours. And 
those men they entertaine in good voiages haue such good 
pay, and such acquaintance one with another in shipping 
themselues, that thirty or forty of them would trouble a 
man of warre with three or foure times their number man&shy;
ned with prest men, being halfe of them scarce hale Bou&shy;
lings. Yea, and many times a Pirat who are commonly the 
best manned, but they fight only for wealth, not for ho&shy;
nour nor revenge, except they bee extremely constrained. 
But such a Ship as I haue spoken of well manned with ra&shy;
ther too many than too few, with all sufficient Officers; 
Shot, Powder, Victuall, and all their appurtenances, in my 
opinion might well passe muster for a man of warre.

<heading>His reward that
first discries a
Ship, or enters a
prize.</heading>
Now being at Sea, the tops are seldome without one or 
other to looke out for purchase, because hee that first dis&shy;
ries a saile, if she proue prize, is to haue a good sute of A&shy;
parell, or so much money as is set downe by order for his 
reward, as also he that doth first enter a Ship there is a cer&shy;
taine reward allowed him;

<heading>How to giue
chase, and escape
the chafer.</heading>
when wee see a Ship alter her 
course, and vseth all the meanes she can to fetch you vp, 
you are the chase, and hee the chaser. In giuing chase or 
chasing, or to escape being chased, there is required an in&shy;
finite iudgement and experience, for there is no rule for it; 
but the shortest way to fetch vp your chase is the best. If 
you bee too lee-ward, get all your Tacks aboord, and shape 
your course as he doth to meet him at the neerest angle you 
can, then he must either alter his course and Tacke as you 
Tacke as neere the wind as he can lye to keepe his owne till 
night, and then strike a Hull that you may not descry him 
by his sailes, or doe his best to lose you in the darke; for
looke how much he falls to lee-ward, hee falls so much in
</page>

<page no="57">
your way. If he be right ahead of you, that is called a sterne 
chase, if you weather him, for euery man in chasing doth 
seeke to get the weather, because you cannot boord him 
except you weather him, he will laske, or goe large, if you 
gather on him that way, hee will trie you before the wind, 
then if your ordnance cannot reach him, if he can out-strip 
you he is gone: But suppose you are to wind-ward, if hee 
clap close by a wind, and there goes a head sea, and yours a 
lee-ward ship, if you doe the like your ship will so beat a&shy;
gainst the Sea, she will make no way; therefore you must 
goe a little more large though you chase vnder his lee till 
you can run ahead.

Boord and Boord is when two ships lie together side by 
side, but hee that knoweth how to defend himselfe, and 
worke well, will so cun his ship, as force you to enter vpon 
his quarter, which is the highest part of the ship, and but 
the mizen shrouds to enter by; from whence he may do you 
much hurt with little danger, except you fire him, which 
a Pirat will neuer doe, neither sinke you if he can chuse, 
except you be able to force him to defend himselfe.</xpln></wordentry>

But in a 
Sea fight wee call Boording, in Boording where wee can, 
the greatest aduantage for your Ordnance is to boord him 
thwart the hawse, because you may vse all the ordnance 
you haue on one side, and she onely them in her prow; but 
the best and safest boarding for entring is on the bow, but 
you must be carefull to cleare the decks with burning grana&shy;
dos, fire-pots, poutches of powder, to which giue fire by 
a Gunpo<emend err="dw">wd</emend>er match, to preuent traines to</xpln></wordentry>

close fights: I confesse, the charging vpon trenches, and 
the entrances of a breach in a rampire are attempts as despe&shy;
rate as a man would thinke could be performed, but he that 
hath tried himselfe as oft in the entring a resisting ship as I 
haue done both them &amp; the other, he would surely confesse 
there is no such dangerous seruice ashore, as a resolued reso&shy;
lute fight at sea. A ships close fights, are smal ledges of wood 
laid crosse one another like the grates of iron in a prisons win&shy;
dow, betwixt the maine mast, and the fore mast, &amp; are called 
gratings, or nettings as is said, which are made of small 
ropes, much in like manner couered with a saile, the which 
to vndoe is to heaue a kedger, or fix a grapling into them, 
tied in a rope, but a chaine of iron is better, and shearing 
off will teare it in peeces if the rope and anchor hold, some 
haue vsed sheare hookes, which are hookes like sickels fixed 
in the ends of the yards armes, that if a ship vnder saile 
come to boord her, those sheares will cut her shrouds, and 
spoile her tackling, but they are so subiect to breake their 
owne yards, and cut all the ropes comes from the top&shy;
sailes, they are out of request. To conclude, if a ship bee 
open, presently to boord her is the best way to take her.

their Captaine, Purser and Gunner, with their commission, 
cocket, or bils of loading. Out goes the boat, they are 
lanched from the ship side, entertaine them with a generall 
cry, God saue the Captaine and all the company with the 
Trumpets sounding, examine them in particular, and then 
conclude your conditions, with feasting, freedome, or pu&shy;
nishment, as you finde occasion; but alwayes haue as much 
care to their wounded as your owne, and if there be either 
young women or aged men, vse them nobly, which is e&shy;

<heading>How to call a
Counsell of War,
and order a Nauy
at Sea.</heading>
To call a Councell of Warre in a Fleet; There is your 
Councell of Warre to manage all businesses of import, 
and the common Councell for matters of small moment, 
when they would haue a meeting, where the Admirall doth 
appoint it; if in the Admirall, they hang out a flag in the 
maine shrouds; if in the Vice Admirall, in the fore shrouds; 
if in the Reare Admirall, in the mizen; If there bee many 
squadrons, the Admirall of each squadron vpon sundry 
occasions doth carry in their maine tops, flags of sundry 
colours, or else they are distinguished by seuerall pen&shy;
dants from the yards armes; euery night or morning they 
are to come vnder the Lee of the Admirall to salute him 
and know his pleasure, but no Admirall of any squadron is 
to beare his flag in the maine top, in the presence of the 
Admirall generall, except the Admirall come aboord of 
him to Councell, to dinner, or collation, and so any ship 
else where he so resideth during that time, is to weare his 
flag in the maine top. They use to martiall or order those 
squadrons in rankes like Manaples, which is foure square, 
if the wind and Sea permits, a good berth or I distance from

each other, that they becalme not one another, nor come 
not fowle of each other; the Generall commonly in the 
middest, his Vice Admirall in the front, and his Reare 
Admirall in the Rearer or otherwise like a halfe Moone, 
which is two squadrons like two triangles for the two 
hornes, and so the rest of the squadrons behinde each other 
a good distance, and the Generall in the middest of the 
halfe circle, from whence he seeth all his fleet, and sendeth 
his directions, as he findes occasion to whom he pleaseth.

<heading>Stratagems for
Sea-men.</heading>
Now betweene two Nauies they vse often, especially 
in a harbour or road where they are at anchor, to fill old 
Barkes with pitch, tar, traine oile, lincet oile, brim&shy;
stone, rosen, reeds, with dry wood, and such combustible 
things, sometimes they linke three or foure together in the 
night, and puts them adrift as they finde occasion. To 
passe a fort some will make both ship and sailes all black, 
but if the fort keepe but a fire on the other side, and all the 
peeces point blanke with the fire, if they discharge what is 
bewixt them and the fire, the shot will hit if the rule bee 
truly obserued; for when a ship is betwixt the fire and you, 
shee doth keepe you from seeing it till shee bee past it. 
To conclude, there is as many stratagems, aduantages, and 
inuentions to be vsed as you finde occasions, and therefore 
experience must be the best Tutor.

For the soule, trunke, bore, 
fortification, the diuersity of their metals, and diuers other 
curious Theoremes or tearmes vsed about great Ordnance, 
there are so many vncertainties as well in her mounting, 
leuelling vpon her platforme, as also the accidents that may 
happen in the powder, the ground, the aire, and differences 
in proportion, I will not vndertake to prescribe any certaine 
artificiall rule. These proportions following are neere the 
matter, but for your better satisfaction reade Master Digs 
Pantrimetria, Master Smith, or Master Burnes art of Gun&shy;

Digs Stratiaticos, any of those will shew the Theoricke at

practice.

Note that seldome in Ships they vse any Ordnance 
greater than Demy Canons, nor haue they any certainty ei&shy;

Note your Serpentine powder in old time was in meale, 
but now corned and made stronger, and called Canon 
corne powder. 
But that for small Ordnance is called come Powder fine, 
and ought to haue in strength a quarter more, because those 
small Peeces are better fortified than the greater. 
Now if you haue but one sort of Powder for all, abate

In English ships they seldome vse any Marshall, whose

all the rest of the Younkers, or fore-mast-men according to 
their deserts, some 3. some 2. and 1/2. some 1. and l/2. and the

Now the Master, or his right hand Mate, the Gunner,

The Young Gentlemen that desires command at Sea, ought 
well to consider the condition of his ship, victuall, and 
company, for if there be more learners than sailers how
slightly soeuer many esteeme sailers, all the worke to saue, 
ship, goods, and liues must lie vpon them, especially in 
fowle weather, then their labour, hazzard, wet, and cold, is 
so incredible I cannot expresse it. It is not then the number 
of them that here can say at home what I cannot doe I can 
quickly learne, and what a great matter is it to saile a ship, 
or goe to Sea; surely those for a good time will doe more 
trouble than good, I confesse it is most necessary such should 
goe, but not too many in one ship; for if the labour of 
threescore should lie vpon thirty, (as many times it doth) 
they are so ouer-charged with labour, bruises, and ouer&shy;
straining themselues they fall sick of one disease or other, for 
there is no dallying nor excuses with stormes, gusts, ouer&shy;
growne Seas, and lee-shores, and when their victuall is pu&shy;
trified it endangers all: Men of all other professions in 
lightning, thunder, stormes, and tempests with raine and 
snow may shelter themselues in dry houses by good fires, 
but those are the chiefe times Sea-men must stand to their 
tackling, and attend with all diligence their greatest la&shy;
bour vpon the deckes. Many suppose any thing is good e&shy;
nough to serue men at sea, and yet nothing sufficient for 
them ashore, either for their healthes, for their ease, or e&shy;
states, or state; A Commander at Sea should doe well to 
thinke the contrary, and prouide for himselfe and compa&shy;
ny in like manner; also seriously to consider what will bee 
his charge to furnish himselfe at Sea with bedding, linnen, 
armes, and apparrell, how to keepe his table aboord, and 
his expences on shore, and prouide his petty Tally, which 
is a competent proportion according to your number of 
these particulars following.

The petty Tally.

Fine wheat flower close and well packed, Rice, Cur&shy;
rands, Sugar, Prunes, Cynamon, Ginger, Pepper, 
Cloues, greene Ginger, Oyle, Butter, Holland cheese, or

old Cheese, Wine vineger, Canarie sacke, Aqua vita, 
the best Wines, the best waters, the iuyce of Limons for 
the scuruy, white Bisket, Oatmeale, gammons of Bacon, 
dried Neats tongues, Beefe packed vp in vineger, Legs of 
Mutton minced and stewed, and close packed vp, with 
tried sewet or butter in earthen pots. To entertaine stran&shy;
gers Marmalad, Suckets, Almonds, Comfits and such 
like.

The vse of the
petty Tally.
</heading>
Some it may be will say I would haue men rather to feast 
than fight; But I say the want of those necessaries occa&shy;
sions the losse of more men than in any English fleet hath 
beene slaine since 88. For when a man is ill, or at the point 
of death, I would know whether a dish of buttered Rice 
with a little Cynamon, Ginger, and Sugar, a little minced 
meat, or rost Beefe, a few stewed Prunes, a race of greene 
Ginger, a Flapjacke, a can of fresh Water brewed with a 
little Cinamon, Ginger, and Sugar bee not better than a 
little poore Iohn, or salt fish with oile and mustard, or bis&shy;
ket, butter, cheese, or oatmeale pottage on fish dayes, or 
on flesh dayes salt Beefe, Porke, and Pease with six shillings 
beere, this is your ordinary ships allowance, and good for 
them are well if well conditioned, which is not alwayes 
as Sea-men can (too well) witnesse. And after a storme, when 
poore men are all wet, and some haue not so much as a cloth 
to shift him, shaking with cold, few of those but wil tell you 
a little Sacke or Aqua vita is much better to keepe them in 
health, than a little small beere, or cold water although it 
be sweet. Now that euery one should prouide those things 
for himselfe, few of them haue either that prouidence or 
meanes, and there is neither Ale-house, Tauerne, nor 
Inne to burne a faggot in, neither Grocer, Poulterer, Apo&shy;
thecary, nor Butchers shop, and therefore the vse of this 
petty Tally is necessary, and thus to be imploied as there is 
occasion. To entertaine strangers as they are in quality e&shy;
uery Commander should shew himselfe as like himselfe as he 
can, as well for the credit of the ship, and his setters forth,
</page>

<page no="76">
as himselfe; but in that herein euery one may moderate 
themselues according to their owne pleasures, therefore 
leave it to their owne discretions, and this briefe 
discourse, and my selfe to their friendly 
construction and good opinion.
