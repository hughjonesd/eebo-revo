Trinitie, in vndeuideable Vnitie. Whose wisedome and power,

The Generall Preface, <f type="bl">To the Christian
Reader.
</heading>

<f type="r">THe end of Teaching, is to cause
others to learn; &amp; to learne, is to know things to be,
what they are. Now of things to be knowne, words are notes
or markes, leading the minde
to the comprehension of the thinges. It cannot bee then, but
a great hinderance to the vnderstanding of
things; when words, which betoken and signify things, are
not vnderstanded; and a great furtheraunce, when they be
vnderstood. Wherefore, as it is necessary in Grammar
Schooles, that Children which learne French, Latine, or
Greeke, haue their Dictionaries and Lexicons allowed them,
to enterpret such harde and strange wordes, by knowledge
whereof, things to bee learned, become more easie; and their
labours, which haue composed such Bookes, are much to be
commended. So I haue wondered, that of so many, woorthy,
</page>

<page no="">
learned, and Godly Diuines, which are as willing for their
loue to the good of the Church, as able for their
sufficiency of gifts; not one, no not one (that I knowe)
haue euer attempted to prouide our Christian Scholler such a
Christian Dictionary of wordes, as containe the secrets of
our Heauenly profession and Art. Many haue framed and set
forth Primers, and A. B. C<SUP>s</SUP>. for beginners; I
meane Catechismes, to enter them into the knowledge of God:
but not any (as yet) haue set too their hands, to enterpret
in our Mother tongue (in Alphabet order) the cheefe words of
our Science, which being very hard and darkesome, sound in
the eares of our weake Schollers, as Latine or Greeke words,
as indeede, many of them are deriued from these Languages;
and this I haue esteemed,
as no smal let to hinder the profiting in knowledge of holy
Scriptures amongst the vulgar; because, when in their
reading or hearing Scriptures, they meet with such
principall words, as carry with them the Marrowe and pith of
our holy Religion; they sticke at them, as at an vnknowne
language. <f type="bl">Mathias Flaccius Illyricus<f type="r"> (whom I did
not looke vpon, nor vppon <f type="bl">Enchiridion Marlorati,<f type="r">
vntill I had well nie done this worke) hath worthily
performed this in Latine,
by whose helpe, it is easie for a Diuine to do some such
worke in English: I, the vnmeetest
and vnwoorthiest of all my Bretheren, not one of a thousand,
but the meanest of ten thousand; haue attempted this enterprise,
and performed a poore some-thing, sufficient onely, to giue
the more learned an occasion to do some more exact thing in
this kinde. Therefore, for their better encouragement thus
to doo, (besides the breach of the Ice vnto them) I haue
breefely set downe before them, the great and manifold
profits that would arise out of such a worke, being
substantially done. First of all, thy selfe, being a
Minister of the word, it wil bring thee this fruite, that
thou shalt teach with more facility, hauing readie and at
hand, the true and right definition of things. Secondly, the
distinguishing of wordes of
</page>

<page no="">
diuers acceptions, lying alwayes by thee, will ease thee of
some labour in searching, when thou art enforced by occasion
of the Text, to enterpret such words. Thirdly, the people
committed to thy charge, being by meanes of such a Booke,
well acquainted with the cheefe Wordes, which containe any
Doctrine, thou shalt not neede in the course of thy
teaching, to bee alwayes troubled with the opening of such
wordes; but presuming vppon their knowledge, maiest the more
insist and dwell in the pressing
and vrging the Doctrine and practise of the thinges so well
vnderstood before. Now, as touching the hearers, their growth and
proceeding in Christianitie, will be greater and more
speedy, by the help of such a Dictionary;
which hauing giuen light vnto them, to know the principall
wordes of their Art, the matter of Doctrine contained in
these words, and raised out of them, wil be sooner
perceiued, and take better impression. Againe, the right
distinguishing of thinges, the one from the other, when the
Nature and due bounds of euery worde is declared, would
proue some preseruatiue against errors and Heresie, which
commonly arise vpon the ignorance
of things, while they are shuffled confusedly
togither, one thing being
taken for another; or some thing being taken to bee that, it
is not. I could shew this in sundry particulers, one instead
of all: <f type="bl">Iustification;<f type="r"> this word, not rightly
vnderstood, what errors hath it bred? whilst some take it,
to bee the making of our selues iust, infusion of grace in
the hearts of the elect. Others, to be nothing else, but a
making of our actions to become iust and holy; whereas, it
is an absolution of a Sinner from his guiltinesse, and
pronouncing him righteous by God, when he beleeues in his
sonne Christ Iesus. Lastly, it will prouoke Christians more
willingly to reade Scriptures,
when they haue at hand a Dictionary, to declare and expound
such words as they vnderstand not. For, as men aduenture to
cracke that Nut, whose Kernell by cracking is to be
obtained; so the Christian is much moued
</page>

<page no="">
to read, when hee hath, as it were, a cracker to get him the
Kernell; that is, a Dictionarie to giue him the sence of the
words, which he reads. To conclude, it may preuent scruples,
which may arise in some Conscience,
through ignorance of words, and their true and fit meanings.

Now, a few Aduertisements will be requisite to bee added
about this my simple endeuour. First, my care was to put in
no words, but such as were material, &amp; of some moment
and vse. Secondly, if either I haue left out some materiall
wordes, or not giuen all the significations of those whereof
I haue made choise, or giuen more then they haue, or not set
downe the significations for order, so precisely as would
be; let these faults (if any such be) be pardoned by thee,
till they be supplied by some more sufficient: for whom (as
I haue saide) I doo heerein but breake the Ice. Yet heereof,
I woulde haue them take knowledge, that such significations
as I giue, I find them in the word: but if any worde haue
other, or more, it is more then I finde. Thirdly, I would
haue none to think, that my meaning were to giue an exact
definition of euerie thing
(let him be thought verie wise and happie, that can do this)
but some true and familiar explication or description of words, to
make things that be obscure to become
somwhat plainer to the ignorant. Fourthly, these
explications which I do giue, may differ in tearmes from
such explications, as yee shall finde in other mens
Writings of the same
wordes. But I verily trust, that you shall finde for the
most part, an agreement in substaunce of truth. Moreouer, in
citing Scriptures, I haue sometime
noted such places, wherein the words which I doo interpret,
is onely named; Sometime, the place where the Interpretation
is found, with the word; and some places which only haue the
Interpretation, &amp; not the word. I cite few places,
because the light giuen to a worde in one place, will clear
other places where that word is vsed in that same sence,
which the aduised Reader shall 
</page>

<page no="">
discerne by the circumstance of the place. Besides, I haue put some
Ecclesiasticall wordes, which be not found in Scripture, in
so many Sillables, yet are there for the
matter, as <f type="bl">Trinity<f type="r">
and <f type="bl">Sacrament, &amp;c.<f type="r"> Againe, sometime ye shall
finde the word, and sometime the thing, and
sometime both opened. Finally, my request is, that no
Minister do by this Booke
hinder his owne searching, it being intended to be a meane
rather to whet 
his diligence to search more narrowly: nor any hearer vse it
to contention, but to
edification; not for matter of ydle dispute, but for
needfull direction. And if I be longer in the
explanation of some
words, then the Nature of a Dictionary wil beare, or do open
some wordes, which (to some) may seeme needlesse; impute it
eyther vnto the waightinesse of the things, which being
darke and important, neede opening; or vnto the dulnesse of
common Capacities, which see little in diuine matters; or if
ye will, to want of dexterity in my selfe, who haue beene
but of late acquainted with this Trade. Thus entreating thee
(courteous Reader) to
haue consideration of my weakenesse, and of the newnesse and
strangenesse of the worke, fauourably
to pardon wants (which in such a forrest of words and
things, cannot but be many) I commend thee vnto the
mercifull goodnesse and protection of the
Almighty.

Thine to do thee good, Tho: Wilson.

<f type="bl">A short Aduertisement, touching the
commodities<f type="r"> of this
Booke, and the things <f type="bl">performed
in it.
</heading>

<f type="r">CVrteous Reader, albeit in my
generall Preface and particuler Rules, I haue some-what
discouered both my purpose, and the profit of this new
vnwonted worke; yet for thy
better encouragement to bestow the cost in buying, and paines
in Reading, I haue heere
distinctly and seuerally gathered the maine and manifold vses,
whereunto this Booke may serue, if it bee rightly vsed and not
abused, as euery Booke (euen the best) may be, and are.

1 The most wordes of Holy Scripture, both maine and
meane, both proper and borrowed; are heere plainely, and with
few words expounded and opened, to help the Minister to
interpret, and the hearers to vnderstand the Scriptures.

2 The sundry and diuers acceptions and scattered
sences of one and the same
word, are noted and gathered vnder one view, with fit places
of Scripture, agreeing to the diuersities
of the sence.

3 Where any word is by the Holy-Ghost drawne from his proper
sence, to an improper and figuratiue signification,
</page>

<page no="">
there ye haue the name of that Trope or Figure, set down
vnder that Word, whether it be
<f type="bl">Metaphor<f type="r"> or <f type="bl">Metonimie, Irony, Sinecdoche,<f type="r">
or some other; by which meanes, the reason of pulling many
words from the Primitiue signification,
to a secondary, may appeare.

4 Besides single words, this Booke interpreteth very
many double words, compounded of
a Nowne &amp; an Adiectiue, or Epithite. Also sundry
Scripture-Phrases be expounded.

5 In setting down the meaning of the words, this
Dictionary doth very often
point at some wholesome Doctrine, and sometime expresseth
it.

6 All the wordes of foundation (as I verily trust)
which contain the sure grounds of our Faith and Religion, are
heere comprehended.

7 Heere bee giuen the definitions of the Capitall and
chiefe matters, with due proofes of Scripture, to confirme
euery part of the definition, the better to expresse the
nature of things.

8 You shall find not a few Theologicall distinctions
and diuisions, the better to distinguish one thing from
another.

9 Not onely wordes, which beare difference betweene
Protestants and Papists, are written downe and cleared in this
Booke, but also there is a taste giuen, of the oddes and
difference it selfe, in
most points of Controuersie, between vs and them, for the
information of such as haue lesse profited, in discerning the
differences.

10 There bee two thousand Texts of Scripture (at the
least) declared and made plaine, to the vnderstanding of the
simplest.

11 Vnto such words as be hard or waighty, I haue
sometimes added, for fuller
edifycation, short and easie obseruations,
vnder this word [<f type="i">Note<f type="r">] being set in the Margent.
</page>

<page no="">
12 Lastly, this is not the least fruite that may come of
this Dictionary, to the studious and well minded Christian,
that it may cause him more narrowly to search and examine
what signifycation euery word of Scripture may beare: for
out of mine owne experience, I may truly speake it, that
since I took this Booke in hand, it hath caused me a great
deale more thoroughly to
marke the Scriptures, the sweete proportion and large
compasse whereof, I know much better then euer I did.

MY leasure would not suffer me to
read so much of your Dictionary, as I wish I had: but that I
haue perused, giueth me that
good liking of it, that I assure you, I do take it to bee a

such Wordes and phrases as you set downe: besides, the

WHosoeuer dooth but cast his eye ouer any part of this
Worke, must confesse it to bee both painefull and ingenious:
And (which addeth much to the commendation of it) this addeth
not to any that went before. It is farre more easie to adde,
then to inuent: and for ought that I know, the
Author doth not build vpon any
other Mans foundation in
this kinde. But that which Crowneth this, and all such
Christian endeuours, is, the subiect whereabout it doth
conuerse. For though it bee a Dictionary interpreting Words
and Phrases; yet is it a Diuine Dictionary, teaching the
Language of the Holy-Ghost in our owne Natiue toong, which if
a man could once attaine to speake Naturally and kindly, he
would be more powerfully eloquent, then if he spake with the
tongues of men and Angels.

IT is the Custome of worldly men,

comming to it without a Key, because it is kept vnder locke,

from all men (as they be the Sonnes of <f type="bl">Adam<f type="r">) cannot
be enioyed of them, without

more to illuminate such as bee alreadie taught of God.
<f type="bl">Psal. 119, 18.<f type="r"> The other, is so Spirituall, as it is
also Ministeriall; to wit, the Interpretation of Scriptures,
eyther by vocall preaching, or by sounde
Writing of such Scribes as be
skilfull to open the worde of the kingdome. The former Key,
thy humble faithfull Prayers
must prouide, beseeching God thy Father most
instantly, in the name of

wonders of his Law. The latter (as from many other Diuine

Wouldst thou attaine true sence of words, and matter in them hid,
What meaning each word doth containe, from error to be rid?
Doost thou delight to haue in-sight into the Sacred Treasure
Of Christs riches, and with thy fill therein to take thy pleasure?
Then read this worke, which painfull hand hath wrought to ease thy paine,
That in reading Gods holy word, thou mayst reape greater gaine.
Our English tongue, from many tongues, a snatch and smacke hath taken:
As English-men, from forraigne men, their Coats and Sutes haue shapen.
Some words from French, and some from Greeks, mo from the Latines flow.
Some new, some olde; some darke, some plaine, some hard &amp; strange to know.
Some, to some place do giue great light; some darken much some Text;
Some generall in the first place, some speciall in the next.
Some properly sound in this clause, improperly in that:
What some words sound thou knowest right well; some sound thou knowst not what
So, oft-times thou leau'st off to read and search the holy Scriptures,
Because thou vnderstand'st not words, which hide their heauenly Treasures.
But lay this Booke on thy left hand, and Bible on thy right;

IT is a speciall duty of a good Teacher, to know and
deliuer the sound and fit sence of the places and Texts of
Scriptures; and of euery good hearer to looke after the same,
how to vnderstand rightly what he heareth and readeth. In this
behalfe, how much the Church of God is beholding to that
learned iudicious Writer, M.
<f type="bl">Caluin,<f type="r"> all that are learned, do wel know, and
willingly confesse: For when hee meetes with a place, wherein
he seeth men haue made scruple,
he doth in the end (after some sifting of the
matter) strike the Nayle full
on the head, with his resolute
<f type="bl">Census est,<f type="r"> This is the sence or meaning of the
place. And surely, we ought thankfully to receiue what heere
this Author (though in many other
respects, and in this also,
farre inferiour to <f type="bl">Caluin,<f type="r"> out of whom he will
acknowledge to haue suckt his best knowledge) painfully and
freely offereth vnto vs, who heerein imitateth M:
<f type="bl">Caluin;<f type="r"> For, as the one beates out the meaning of a
sentence, so this present Writer,
labours to presse and draw out the Kernel, which lyes hidde
and wrapt in some obscure and doubtfull words. Finally, in
humblenesse of heart, apply thy selfe to profit by this &amp;
other such profitable Books, as are framed to the edification
of the godly Christians,
in their most holy faith. Farewell.

Thine in Christ. I. S:

ALthough words be the significations of things, yet as
<f type="bl">Aug. de doct. Christ. lib. 4. and cap. 11.<f type="r"> saith
verie well: It is a note of the best &amp; wisest men, <f type="bl">In
verbis, verum amare, non verba, quid enim prodest clauis aurea
si aperire quod volumus non
potest? Aut quid obestlignea, si hoc potest, &amp;c.<f type="r"> In
words, to loue the truth more then the wordes; For what
anayleth a Key of Gold, if it cannot open the Treasure that we
would faine enioy? Or what hindereth
a Key of Wood, if it can open it, &amp;c. <f type="bl">Lewes Viues<f type="r">
hath fitly obserued out of
<f type="bl">Augustin de ciu: dei lib. 13. cap. 24. Quanti sit momenti
ad omnes artes disciplinasque intelligendas vera &amp; Germana
vocabularum cognitio.<f type="r"> The true and proper signification
and knowledge of words, is a matter
of great moment and consequence to the vnderstanding of all
Artes. It is verie fit therefore (good Reader) thou shouldst
imitate the wise Traueller, he will be carefull to attaine to
as much skill as may bee in the Languages of all those parts
and Countries through which he is to passe, that he may with
the fewer inconueniences, be
interrupted in the way, and with greater expedition may runne
his intended race and iourney: So thou, in thine intended
iourney to Canaan, if thou be
ignorant of the Language, Customes, Wordes, Phrases,
Meanings, and Orders of the
place and Countrey, wilt meete with a World of
inconueniences, to
interrupt thine intention, and discourage thee in thy course,
so as thou wilt either leaue off, or verie faintly and
vncomfortably go forward. For as the same <f type="bl">Augustine<f type="r">
saith again verie truly, <f type="bl">Nam aut ignotum verbu~, facit
haerere lector<expan type="e+_">em</expan>, antignota locutio;<f type="r"> Either an vnknown

sticke, or an vnknowne Phrase and manner of speaking. Vse
therefore this Booke, which God hath affoorded for thy good,
and for thy guide, reade it diligently, and be much conuersant
therein, it will be a faithfull guide and
Interpreter vnto thee; It
will bring thee acquainted with the Language, Phrase, and
Customes of <f type="bl">Canaan;<f type="r"> It will open vnto thee the hidden
Treasures of heauenly
Wisedome, and it will tell thee in plaine <f type="bl">English<f type="r"> and

thee. Entertaine it kindly, and take it vp vnto thee, as that
Noble <f type="bl">Eunuch<f type="r"> did his guide Phillip. Acts 8, 31, 39.
and it will make thee (as he did) go thy iourney with ioy and
chearefulnesse. As the Sea-men and Marriners in their Voyages,
bee carefull to bring <expression lang="gk">&#x1F40;&#x03C1;&#x03B8;&#x1F70;&#x03BD; &#x03C4;&#x1F70;&#x03BD; &#x03BD;&#x1FB6;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</expression> so be thou in

CVrteous Reader, thou art much bound
to blesse God, for the great plenty and aboundance of
excellent Bookes, which by the handes of his painefull and
godly Seruants he hath afforded thee, as helps and
furtherances to bring thee to the sound knowledge, and right
vnderstanding of his sacred word: But among them all, in my
iudgement, there is no one in our Natiue tongue, that dooth
more oblige thee to true thankfulnesse, then the Booke thou
now beholdest, in regard of
the great necessity and manifolde vse of the same; as also
the exceeding rich profit and benefite, which (by Gods
blessing, if thou make the right vse of it) thou mayst reap
thereby. For beside the multiplicity and great variety of
wholesome matter, which thou shalt finde scattered through
the whole worke, heere thou hast most of the dark words and
phrases contained in the Scripture, in Alphabeticall order;
plainely, breefely, (yet fully) and soundly vnfolded; and in most
places, the corrupt glosses of the Papists vpon them,
compendiously discouered and confuted. Heere thou maist at
one view, see the diuers acceptations and significations of
words, with the figures and Tropes denoted, in which the
Scripture vseth them. By this Book, thou shalt be made able
to distinguish of words, which in Scripture are ambiguous,
to explaine wordes and phrases obscure, and easily to
vnderstand such as bee hard and vnknowne. By this Booke,
if thou be a Minister, thou shalt become <f type="bl">Bonus
Textuarius<f type="r"> (for what is that but to bee able to giue
the true meaning and gemine sense of the Scripture?) and
<f type="bl">bonus Textuarius est bonus Theologus.<f type="r"> This Booke
will make thee a more profitable teacher; for <f type="bl">qui bene
distinguit, bene decet.<f type="r"> By this Booke (whosoeuer thou
be) thou shalt be fortified to shield thy selfe (and haply
others too) from errour, as
also to see when others do erre, and to draw them out of
errour; for errour springes from ignorance; that is, from
misvnderstanding the Scripture. Math. 22, 29. By this thou
shalt bee made skilfull, to discerne

the voyce of thy Shepheard Christ Iesus, from the voyce of a
stranger. Iohn 10, 3, 5. In a word, by this book in short
space, and with no great labour, thou mayst plentifully abound in
all heauenly wisedome and knowledge. So that, as one saith
of <f type="bl">Cicero; Sciat se multum profecisse, cui Cicero vnice
placet;<f type="r"> In like manner, it may more truelie be affirmed
of this Booke; whosoeuer he bee that delighteth much in it,
shall thereby gaine infinite benefit. The Authour hath beene
pleased to entitle this Booke <f type="bl">A Christian Dictionary,<f type="r">
and so it is; for it interprets wordes. But it may also be
worthily called; <f type="bl">The Key of the Treasures hid in holy
Scripture; the enemy of Ignorance; The high and ready path to Knowledge; The
Discloser of Gods holy secrets; A light for Ministers, 
whereat they may borrow light; A Lanthorne for the people,
to direct them in the Light:<f type="r"> And to bee short, the way
to make all the Lords people to prophesie, as <f type="bl">Moses<f type="r">
wished. Then Gentle Reader, be not without it, let it be
continnally by thee, yet buy it not for Nouelty, because it
is the first of this kinde that euer saw the light; but for
the vnualuable worth of it. <f type="bl">Sit tibi charus, non quia
rarus, sed amatus quod amabilis;<f type="r"> 1. <f type="bl">amari dignus.
Seneca<f type="r"> saith; <f type="bl">Noua, quamuis non magna,
miramur.<f type="r"> That we make much of new things, though they
bee not great. Loe, in this Booke, they both meete together,
heere is newnesse, and heere is goodnesse. This worke is
new, and it is precious,
how then, should it not much Inamour thee?

A Preface before the Table.
</heading>

GEntle Reader, in this vast Ocean,
and large Forrest of words contained in this
Dictionary, I doe find
that there be three sorts most materiall; where of I desire
that thou sholdst take more especiall notice and knowledge, as
being of more worth and waight. The first I call an
Ecclesiasticall word, which being translated from common vse
of speech, is by the Church appropriated,
to signifie holy and diuine things. A word of this kind,
though it be not in the Scripture for Letter and Sillables:
yet is to be found there for matter and substance; as
Trinity, &amp;c. Sacrament,
Indifferent, Satisfaction, Merit, &amp;c.

A word of the second rancke, I doe tearme
<f type="bl">Polemicall;<f type="r"> because it pertaines to Controuersie,
&amp; hath in it a ground of difference betweene the true
Christian, which thinketh, speaketh, and writeth
<f type="bl">Orthodoxally,<f type="r"> and soundly; and
others, which loue and embrace
errors, in fauour where of they wrest, and peruert the pure
wordes of Scripture: as <f type="bl">Iustification, Assurance, of
Faith, Hope of Glory, Concupiscence,
Antichrist,<f type="r"> &amp;c.

A word of the third sort, is called <f type="bl">Fundamentall,<f type="r">
of which kind, I doe take such wordes to be, as doe containe
in them things, which beeing denyed, Religion it selfe is
ouerthrowne; euen as an house is ouer-turned, by taking away
the foundation or ground-worke whereuppon it stands; as
<f type="bl">Grace, Fayth, God, Christ,<f type="r"> &amp;c. for the
descerning of these words
from other, I iudge this to be a
necessary rule.

A word, containing in it anything, which being denyed,
<note type="margin">
A Rule
whereby to
iudge a fun&shy;
damentall
word.
</note>
either God himselfe, any person of the God-head, the decrees
of God, his properties, his workes of Creation and
prouidence, his word of Law and Gospell: or Christ Iesus the
Mediator, his Person, Natures, Offices, benefits,
</page>

<page no="">
Church, and people be denied; either directly, or by necessary and immediate
consequence. Any such word is <f type="bl">Fundamentall,<f type="r"> for
that must needs be the foundation of an House, which being
remooued, the house cannot but fall. Of this Nature be the
wordes, vpon deniall whereof, followes
the ruine of the whole Fabricke of Religion.

Of these three kindes of words, I haue heere drawne a Table
after the order of the Alphabet, setting a Starre * before an
<f type="bl">Ecclesiasticall<f type="r"> word, to know it by. I haue
prefixed this sillable
[<f type="bl">Con<f type="r">] aboue a Polemical word, and haue placed an
[<f type="bl">F<f type="r">] ouer the head of a fundamentall word: where it
happeneth, that any one word is both an
<f type="bl">Ecclesiasticall,<f type="r"> &amp; a word of
<f type="bl">Controuersie,<f type="r"> I haue written vpon the top of it, both
a Star, and this sillable [<f type="bl">Con.<f type="r">] Also, you shall find
this sillable [<f type="bl">Con<f type="r">] and an [<f type="bl">F<f type="r">] ouer euery
word, which is both <f type="bl">Polemicall,<f type="r"> and a word of
<f type="bl">Foundation.<f type="r">

Moreouer, whereas I haue with the explication of words,
sometimes ioyned the definition of the thing expressed by such
a word, ye shall finde this sillable [<f type="bl">Def.<f type="r">] put vnder
the foote of such a word. And those words in this Table that
doe admit distinctions, they are noted out by this sillable
[<f type="bl">Dist.<f type="r">] directly put vnder the word.

Finally, if in the draught, either of this Table, or of
this whole Dictionary, I haue failed in any thing (as no doubt
but I haue, being but a man; and therefore subiect to
error, from which no Booke is
priuiledged, sauing the book of Bookes,) I do earnestly
entreate thee to couer my slips by loue, eyther amending them,
or admonishing mee of them: doing vnto me, as in the like case
thy selfe wouldest bee done vnto: euer remembring, that it is
much easier to dislike, then to doe the like. The former, will
cost thee nothing; but the
latter (trust me) will cost thee paines, vnto sweate and
wearinesse, if thou wilt but endeuour to doe what I haue done
before thee.

Farewell.

of sinfull Nature; and in al other places where the word
[<f type="bl">Flesh<f type="r">] is applyed to men vnregenerate, it
signifies the whole corruption and naughtinesse of our
Nature, raging and raigning both in the reason and will:
but in those places of Scripture, where [<f type="bl">Flesh<f type="r">]
is attributed to new-borne persons, and is set against
the spirit, as in <f type="bl">Gal.<f type="r"> 5, 17, 19, 24

vicious quality of sinne, as still sticketh behind in
regenerate persons,
and is vnmortified. The reason and cause why sinne is
noted out by the name of [<f type="bl">Flesh<f type="r">] it is, because
through the Flesh (to wit our Seede) or through carnall
generation, sinne is conueyed into the whole man, Soule
and Body: also, for that the Flesh or Body is the
instrument to execute the lustes of our naturall

affections) meant by
Flesh.

<xpln>
Vsury, is any encrease or vantage, for lone of Money,
or other things, imposed or layde by the lender vpon the
borrower onely, in consideration of the lending. Ezek. 18,
5, 6. <f type="bl">Deut.<f type="r"> 13, 19, 20. Or more breefely thus:
Vsury, is a certaine gaine aboue the principall, exacted
vppon Couenant for the vse of money, or other things lent.
Exod. 22, 25. <f type="bl">Thou shalt not impose Vsury vpon
him.<f type="r"> Thus it is in the Haebrew Text.

<f type="bl">Fiue things belonging to Vsury.<f type="r">

Vnto Vsurie these fiue things are necessarily
required. 1. A
principall, as wares, or sum of money. 2. Lending. 3.
Gaine. 4. A chiefe purpose by lending
to encrease our stocke. 5. a Couenant for that end.

As the verie desire and expectation of gaine, for
lending onely, is mentall and intentionall Vsurie:
<note type="margin">
Note.
</note>
so the imposing, or by Couenant before hand,
agreeing for encrease
aboue the principall, is of the Nature of actuall Vsury.

<f type="bl">In all these three cases, there is no Imposition of
encrease, that is, no
fore-Couenant, binding absolutely
the borrower to pay gaine with the stocke.<f type="r">

There are three cases wherein encrease may bee
<note type="margin">

taken by a lender without danger of Vsury. First, when
the borrower hauing by lawfull meanes, made some great
gaine by money freely lent, doth
</page>

<page no="">
by way of Thankefulnesse, out of the voluntary
motion of his owne heart,
returne some-thing aboue the principall vnto the lender,
by whose means he had such a blessing.

2 When it may be duly and apparantly proued, without
pretence and collusion, that the borrower by holding backe
the money lent him after the day agreed vpon for paiment,
without the leaue of the lender, doth become heereby a
direct and effectual cause of hinderance to the Lender,
either by damage arising to
him, or by fore-going some commoditie
which he might well haue made with his money, had it come
home at the appointed time.

3 When the Lender is content to hazard the principall,
and to beare part of the losse, if any fal to the
borrower, without his owne default. Heere he lawfully may
take part of the gain which commeth by good meanes.</xpln></wordentry>

A Dictionarie, for that <f type="bl">Mysticall
Booke, called the Reuelation of<f type="r"> Saint Iohn.
</heading>

OF this Booke it hath been said,
that euery word is a Mystery, and surely not without cause:
for not only is the truth of it hid from the naturall man (as
all other diuine truths be, which concernes our saluation by
Christ.) 1 Cor. 2. but being a propheticall
Booke, of thinges long after to be done and penned, in darke
phrases, borrowed from the old Prophets. The
vnderstanding of it hath been found hard, euen to the godly,
and the learned. Whence it is, that some eschew the reading of
it priuately, others decline the publike reading, others
forbeare to Comment vpon it, and some haue refrained from
Preaching out of it.
Howbeit, it being a part of holy Scripture, penned by the Spirit,
for the comfort and instruction of the Church, in these la<damage></damage>d worst
daies, there beeing a gratious promise of a pretious blessing, mde to the
reading and hearing of it, and the euent of the Prophesies, therein now
for the most part fulfilled (the best Commentary of
propheticall writings) giuing great light to the true
knowledge of things; therefore, as their
labour is to be much commended,
who haue by their Sermons and interpretations
(Preached and Printed) endeuoured to make cleere this obscure
Scripture: so let not me be thought to haue taken in hand, a
bold or needelesse
enterprise, by aduenturing to anatomize and vnbowell this
whole Booke in a short Dictionary, pulling the words in sunder, and
putting them in Alphabeticall order, for help of young
Students in Diuinity, and vulgar
Christians, which will more willingly assay to read and study
this book when they shall haue at hand a declaration of
all mysticall wordes familiarly
deliuered. Howsoeuer I please or profit others by my endeuour;
yet I hope to offend the lesse, because I tread in the steps
of our most learned and soundest expositours, whose opinions,
with their reasons, I doe report,
leauing it to the Reader to
consider of.

might bee found, when Saint <f type="bl">Iohn<f type="r"> wrote (else in

vnder hope of attaining some benefit by their paines. Vse
