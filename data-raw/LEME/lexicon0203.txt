Nor are these all, for euerie third line hath some of 
this ouer-rackt absonisme. Nor do I altogether scum 
off all these as the newe ingendred fome of the Eng&shy;
lish, but allowe some of them for a neede to fill vp a 
verse; as <f type="i">Traynment<f type="r">, and one or two wordes more, 
which the libertie of prose might well haue spar'd. 
In a verse, when a worde of three sillables cannot 
thrust in but sidelings, to ioynt him euen, we are of&shy;
tentimes faine to borrowe some lesser quarry of elo&shy;
cution from the Latine, alwaies retaining this for a 
principle, that a leake of indesinence as a leake in a 
shippe, must needly bee stopt, with what matter soe&shy;
uer.

<f type="i">Chaucers<f type="r"> authoritie I am certaine shalbe alleadgd

<f type="i">Chaucer<f type="r"> liu'd to this age, I am verily perswaded hee
would haue discarded the tone halfe of the harsher
sort of them,

They were the Oouse which ouerflowing barba&shy;
risme, withdrawne to her Scottish Northren chanell, 
had left behind her. Art like yong grasse in the spring 
of <f type="i">Chaucers<f type="r"> florishing, was glad to peepe vp through 
any slime of corruption, to be beholding to she car'd 
not whome for apparaile, trauailing in those colde 
countries. There is no reason that shee a banisht 
Queene into this barraine soile, hauing monarchizd 
it so long amongst the Greeks and Romanes, should 
(although warres furie had humbled her to some ex&shy;
tremitie) still be constrained when she hath recouerd 
her state, to weare the robes of aduersitie, iet it in her 
old rags, when she is wedded to new prosperitie.

Thou art mine enemie <f type="i">Gabriell<f type="r">, and that which is
