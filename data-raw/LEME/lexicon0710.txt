There was of late dayes one of the Peeres 
of England sent to Weiseford as Commissi&shy;
oner, to decide the controuersies of that cou~&shy;
trey, and earing in affable wise the rude com&shy;
plaintes of the countrey clownes, he concey&shy;
ued here and there, sometyme a worde, other 
whyles a sentence. The noble man beyng ve&shy;
ry glad that vpon hys first commyng to Ire&shy;
land, he vnderstood so many wordes, told one 
of hys familiar frends, that he stoode in very 
great hope, to become shortly a well spoken 
man in the Irishe, supposing that the blunte
people had pratled Irishe, all the while they 
iangled Englishe. Howbeit to this day, the 
dregs of the olde auncient Chaucer English, 
are kept as well there as in Fingall. As they

And where as commonly in all countreys, 
the women speake most neately and pertely, 
whiche Tully in hys thirde booke <term lang="la">de Oratore</term>, 
speakyng in the person of Grassus, seemed to 
haue obserued, yet notwithstandyng in Ire&shy;
land it fall<emend err="o">e</emend>th out contrary. For the women 
haue in theyr English tongue an harrish and 
broade kynd of pronunciation, with vtteryng 
their wordes so peeuishly &amp; faintly, as though 
they were halfe sicke, and ready to call for a 
possette. And most commonly in wordes of 
two sillables, they giue the last the accent. As 
they say, Markeate, Baskeate, Gossoupe, 
Pussoate, Robart, Niclase, &c. which doubt&shy;
lesse doth disbeautifie their Englishe aboue 
measure. And if they could be weaned from 
that corrupt custom, there is none that could 
dislyke of their English.
