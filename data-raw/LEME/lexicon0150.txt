An Arithmeticall Militare Treatise, named
STRATIOTICOS:
Compendiously teaching the Science of N<expan type="">um</expan>bers,
as well in Fractions as Integers, and so much of the Ru&#173;
les and &#198;quations Algebraicall and Arte of Numbers 
Cossicall, as are requisite for the Profession of Soldiour.

Together with the Moderne Militare Discipline, Offices, Lawes and
Dueties in euery wel gouerned Campe and Armie to be obserued:
Long since att<expan type="">em</expan>pted by LEONARD DIGGES Gentleman,
Augmented, digested, and lately finished, by 
THOMAS DIGGES, his Sonne.

Whereto he hath also adioyned certaine Questions of great Ordinaunce,
resolued in his other Treatize of Pyrotechny and great
Artillerie, hereafter to bee published.
