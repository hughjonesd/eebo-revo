Originall.

THe names contayned

name Dogge, because of the similitude and likenesse of the 
wordes I will not stand in contradiction (friende <term lang="en">Gesner</term>) for 
so much as we retaine among vs at this day many Dutche 
wordes which the Saxons left at such time as they occupyed 
this country of Britane. Thus much also vnderstand, that 
as in your language <term lang="du">Hunde</term> is the common word, so in our 
naturall tounge dogge, is the vniuersall, but <term lang="en">Hunde</term> is per&shy;
ticuler and a speciall, for it signifieth such a dogge onely as 
serueth to hunt, and therfore it is called a hunde.</xpln></wordentry>

wherefore we call him a Leuyner of this worde <term lang="la">Leuitas</term>? (as 
we doe many things besides) why we deriue and drawe a
