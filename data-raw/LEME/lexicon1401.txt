Rider draws from the gentle and delicate 
Effects of the Bridle, Cavezon, Spurs, Rod, 
Action of his Legs, and pressure of his Thighs; 
As also from the sound or Clack of his Tongue, 
to make a Horse ride just, and as he ought: They 
are also made use of to prevent Chastisements, 
which a man is sometimes obliged to make use 
of, while he is a dressing Horses. See Suppl. p. 26 &amp;c</xpln></wordentry>

<wordentry type="h"><form lang="fr">AIR. An Air,</form> <xpln lang="en">is a Cadence and Liberty of 
movement, accommodate to the natural Dispo&shy;
sition of a Horse, which maketh him Ride, and 
Raise himself, according to the Riders Inclinati&shy;

They are generally reckoned to be six. See

Reciprocal Sentiment or Feeling, betwixt the

a Horse's rest upon the Bit mouth: And 3ly. For 
the Pressure of the Bit-mouth on the Barrs</xpln></wordentry>

<wordentry type="h"><form lang="fr">APPUY &agrave; Pleine-main.</form> <xpln lang="en">Is a firm Pressure of 
a Horse's Barrs against the Bit-mouth, but how&shy;
ever, so as not to be heavy on the Rider's hand; 
and this is a Quality which all Horses appointed 
for the Warrs, ought to have; because they are 
thereby the more sure for the Rider, who in time 
of Action, cannot be supposed to consider atten&shy;
tively the Aides of his Bridle-hand.</xpln></wordentry>

<wordentry type="h"><form lang="fr">APPUY au de l&agrave; de Pleine-main.</form> <xpln lang="en" lexeme="appui(n)">Is a very 
hard pressure of a Horse's Barrs against the Bit-&shy;
mouth, but however, so as not to force the 
Rider's hand, and therefore may be turn'd, and 
Stopt with a little strength: This kind of Appuy 
is thought convenient for such people, as hav&shy;
ing weak Thighs, cannot keep themselves firm 
on Horse-back with them, and therefore hold 
fast, and cleave to the Bridle-reins.</xpln>

Rider in the suppling of his Shoulders: Those 
of Iron, flat upon the inside, and also quilted 
with soft Leather, are most proper for this, and 
those of Cord or Leather fittest to be made use
