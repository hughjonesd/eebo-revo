&leaf; To the most reuerend Father in God,
his especiall good Lord, the Lord Archbishop
of Canterburie, Primate and Metropolitan of all En&#173;
gland, and one of his Maiesties most Ho&#173;
nonr able Priuy Councell.

AFTER long deliberation, I hardly indu&#173;
ced my selfe to craue your gracious prote&#173;
ction toward this simple worke: valewing
it at so lowe a price, as I thinke it hardly
woorth the respect of any graue man, much
lesse the fauourable aspect of so honorable
a personage. Yet the remembrance of those
your fatherly prouocations, whereby, at
my comming to your Grace from the Vniuersitie, you first put me
vpon these studies, at the last by a kind of necessitie inforced me to
this attempt: because I could not see how well to auoide it, but by
aduenturing the hatefull note of vnthankfulnesse. For I cannot
without dissimulation, but confesse my selfe perswaded, that this
poore Pamphlet may proue profitable to the young Students of
both Lawes, to whose aduancement that way, I haue of late addi&#173;
cted mine indeuours: else were I more then madde to offer it to the
world: and to offer it without mention of him, that by occasioning
of this good, more or lesse, deserueth the prime thankes, were to
proue my selfe vnworthie of so grave advice.

And therefore howsoeuer I accompt this too much boldnesse
in respect of the subiect yet could I be exceedingly glad, it might
please your Grace to ascribe mine intention to the integrity of my
duty. For he that meaneth truly wel, &#38; cannot perform much: must

<page sig="*2v">
needes reioyce at the good acceptance of that litle which he per&#173;
formeth.

All I craue for this at your Graces hands, is patience and par&#173;
don for this enterprise, with the continuance of those your many
fauours, that hitherto to my great comfort I haue enioyed. And
so my long obseruation of your iudicious disposition, hauing
taught me, what small delight you take in affected complements
and verball commendation, without more words, in all true hum&#173;
blenes, I beseech the Almighty long to continue your Grace in
health and prosperitie, to his glorie, and the good of his Church.

Your Graces at all Commaundment,

To the Readers.

GENTLE Readers, I heere offer my selfe to
your censures, with no other desire, then by you
to be admonished of my faults. For though 1 doe
professe the amplifying of their workes, that
haue gone before me in this kinde, and haue both
gathered at home, and brought from abroade
some ornaments for the better embellishing of our English lawes:
yet am  I  neither so vaine, as to denie mine imperfections, nor so
passionate, as to be offended at your charitable reformation. Nay,
my true ende is the advauncement of knowledge; and therefore
haue  I  published this poore worke, not onely to impart the good
thereof to those young ones that want it: but also to drawe from
the learned the supply of my defects: and so by degrees, if not my
selfe to finish this modell, yet at the least, by the heate of emulation
to incense some skilfuller architect thereunto. Yea,  I shall thinke
my paines sufficiently recompensed, if they may be found but
worthy to stirre vp one learned man to amend mine er&#173;
rours.

The Ciuilians of other nations, haue by their mutuall industries
raised this kinde of worke in their profession, to an inexpected excel&#173;
lencie, I haue seene many of them that haue be stowed very profita&#173;
ble and commendable paines therin: and lastly one Caluinus  a Do&#173;
ctor of  Heidelberge, like a laborious Bee, hath gathered from all the
former, the best iuyce of their flowers, and made vp a hiue full of
delectable honie. And by this example would I gladly incite the lear&#173;
ned in our common lawes and antiquities of England, yet to lend
their aduice, to the gayning of some comfortable lights &#38; prospects
toward the beautifying of this aunctent palace, that hitherto hath
bene accoumpted (howsoeuer substantiall) yet but darke and melan&#173;
choly.

Whosoeuer will charge these my traueiles with many ouer&#173;

sights, he shall neede no solemne paines to prooue them. For I will ea&#173;
sily confesse them. And, vpon my view taken of this booke sithence
the impression, I dare assure them that shall obserue most faults
therein, that I by gleaning after him, will gather as many omitted
by him, as he shall shew committed by me. But I learned long si&#173;
thence out of famous Tullie; that as no mans errours ought to be
folowed, because he sayeth some things well: so that which a man
saith well, is not to be reiected, because he hath some errours. No
man, no booke is voide of imperfections. And therefore reprehend
who will, in Gods name: that is, with sweetnes, and without re&#173;
proche. So shall be reape hartie thankes at my hands: and by true
imitation of the most iudicious that euer wrote, more soundly helpe
on this pointe of learning to perfection in a fewe monethes,
then I by tossing and tumbling my bookes at home, could possibly
haue done in many yeares. Experience hath taught me this in
mine Institutes lately set forth: by publishing whereof I haue
gained the iudicious obseruations of diuers learned gentlemen vpon
them, which by keeping them priuate I could neuer haue procured.
By which meanes I hope one day to commend them to you againe
in a more exact puritie, and so leaue them to future times for such
acceptance, as it shall please God to giue them.

I haue in some towardnes a tract (<term lang="la">de regulis iuris</term>) where&#173;
in my intent is, by collating the cases of both lawes, to shewe,
that they both be raised of one foundation, and differ more in lan&#173;
guage and termes then in substance, and therefore were they redu&#173;
ced to one methode (as they easily might) to be attained (in a maner)
with all one paines. But my time imparted to these studies, being
but stolne from mine emploiments of greater necessitie,  I cannot
make the hast I desire, or perhaps that the discourse may deserue.
Wherefore vntill my leisure may serue to performe that,  I intreate
you louingly to accept this.

One thing I haue done in this booke, whereof, because it may
seeme straunge to some,  I thinke to yeld my reason: and that is the
inserting not onely of words belonging to the art of the lawe, but






</page>

<page sig="*4r">
of any other also, that I thought obscure, of what sort soeuer; as
Fish, Cloth, Spices, Drugs, Furres, and such like. For in this I fol&#173;
low the example of our Ciuilians, that haue thought it their part to
expound any thing they could meete with in their walke. And in
deede a Lawyer professeth true Philosophy, and therefore should
not be ignorant (if it were possible) of either beastes, foules, or
creeping things, nor of the trees from the Cedar in Lebanon, to the
Hyssop that springeth out of the wall. And therefore, if I haue ei&#173;
ther omitted any hard word within my circuit, or set it downe
not expounded;  I giue you good leaue to impute the one to my negli&#173;
gence, the other to mine ignorance: and so c<expan type="">om</expan>mend these my paines
to your best profit, and you vnto God. Nouember. 3. 1607.

in the remembrance, intendm<expan type="">en</expan>t,

so in the same place: the Francke
tenement of the glebe of the

the time that the parsonage is
void, but is in abeyance. And
againe: It is a principle in lawe,
that of euery land there is Fee&#173;
simple in some man, or the Fee&#173;
simple is in abeyance. Conside&#173;
ring these places, and comparing
them with the signification of
the French word, I am driuen to
thinke, that our auncient Law&#173;
yers would signifie hereby a kind
of hope, or longing expectance:
because that those things that be
in abeyance, though for the pre&#173;

cannot in mine owne opinion
better compare this, then to that
which the Civilians call <term lang="la">h&#230;redi&#173;

saith (lib. 1. eap. 12. nu. 10) <term lang="la">H&#230;&#173;

these words in effect: He that

may stay there for eight dayes.
And at the ninth day he must be
demaunded, whether he will
yeeld himselfe to secular iustice,
or hold him to the Church. For
if he will, he may yeeld himselfe

But this grew at the last vpon
good reason to be but a perpe&#173;

that abiuration at this day hath
place but in few cases: and if it
be inflicted vpon any, it is not a
confining to a Sanctuarie (for

<wordentry type="h"><form lang="en" lexeme="action upon the statute(n)">Action vpon the statute (<term lang="la">actio

f<expan type="">en</expan>ces, as are either newly grown,
or more and more increased: and
our Iudges intertaine their plees,
that commence actions against
the breakers of them.

Action is perpetuall or tem&#173;
porall (<term lang="la">perpetua vel temporalis</term>) and
that is called perpetuall, the
force whereof is by no time de&#173;
termined. Of which sort were all
ciuill actions among the aunci&#173;
ent Romaines, viz. such as grew
from lawes, decrees of the Se&#173;

by the Pretor, died within the
yeare, <term lang="la">de perpet. &#38; tempor. actio. in

perpetuall and temporarie acti&#173;
ons: and I thinke all may be cal&#173;

giue actions, so they be pursued

For commonly with vs, an arrest
is taken for the execution of the
commaundement of some court,
or of some officer in iustice. But
howsoeuer the name began: an
arrest is a certaine restraint of a
mans person, depriuing him of
his owne will and libertie, and
binding it to become obedient
to the will of the lawe. And it
may be called the beginning of
imprisonment. Precepts &#38; writs
of the higher courts of lawe, do
vse to expresse it by two sundry
words: as (<term lang="la">capias</term>) and (<term lang="la">attachies</term>)
which signifie to take or catch

15. daies of preparation, except
they be tried in those standing

as appeareth by Fitzh. nat. br. fo.

called assises, because they are
tried most commonly by especi&#173;
al courts, set &#38; appointed for the
purpose: as may be well proved
not onely out of the custumarie
of Normandie, but our bookes
also: which shew, that in aunci&#173;

And note that assise in this signi&#173;
fication, is taken foure waies, Old
nat. br. fol. 105. The first, is assise
at large, which is taken aswell
vpon other points, as vpon the
disseisin. For example, where an
infant bringeth an assise, and the
deed of his auncestor is pleaded,
where by he claimeth his right
or foundeth his title: then the as&#173;
sise shall be taken at large: that
is, the Iurie shall enquire, not on&#173;
ly whether the plaintiffe were
disseised or not by the tenent, but
also of these other points: viz.
whether his auncestor were of
full age, of good memorie, and
out of prison, when he made the
deed pleaded. Another example
out of Kitchin, fol. 66. The te&#173;
nent pleadeth a forraine release,
in barre to an assise, whereupon
the cause was adiourned. At the






</page>

<page sig="F2r">
day the tenent maketh default.
Therefore the assise was taken at
large: that is, not onely whether
the plaintiffe were disseised, but
also whether there be any such
forraine release. A third example
you may reade in Litleton. cap.
Estates vpon condition. The se&#173;
cond maner of assise in point
of assise (<term lang="la">assisa in modum assis&#230;</term>)
which is, when the tenent, as it
were, setting foote to foot with
the demandant, without furder
circumstance, pleadeth directly
contrarie to the writ, no wrong,
no disseisin. The third manner is,
assise out of the point of assise
<term lang="la">(assisa extra assisam, vel in modum
iurat&#230;.) viz.</term> when the tenent al&#173;
ledgeth some by exception, that
must be tried by a Iurie, before
the principall cause can proceed:
as it he pleade a foreine release,
or foreine mater tryable in ano&#173;
ther countie. For in this case, the
Iustices referre the record to the
Court of common plees, for the
triall of the foreine plee, before
the disseisin can come to be dis&#173;
cussed. Of this sort reade diuers
other examples in Bracton, lib. 4.
part. 1. cap. 34. For there be of
them (as he saith) and Britton al&#173;
so, cap. 52. both dilatorie and
peremptorie. The fourth and last
manner is: assise of right of dam&#173;
mages, and that is, when the te&#173;
nent confessing a putting out,
and referring it to a demurrer in
lawe, whether it were rightly
done or not, is adiudged to haue
done wrong. For then shall the
demandant haue a writ to reco&#173;
uer dammages, which is called
assise to recouer dammages, as
also the whole processe. </xpln></wordentry>

court, place, or time, where and
when the writs and processes of
assise be handled or taken.
And in this signification assise is
generall: as when the Iustices
passe their seuerall circuits, euery
couple with their commission,
to take all assises twice in the
yeare. For he that speaketh of a&#173;
ny thing done, at that time, and
in that place, will commonly
say, that it was done at the ge&#173;

speciall, in this signification: as if
an especiall commission should
be granted to certaine (as in an&#173;

taking of an assise vpon one dis&#173;
seisin or two: any thing done in

would say, it was done at such an
especiall assise. And in this very
signification doth Glanvil vse it,

to take or apprehend by com&#173;

Lamberd in his eirenarch. li. 1. cap.
16. maketh this difference be&#173;
tweene an arrest and an attache&#173;
ment, that an arrest proceedeth
out of lower courts by precept,
and an attachment out of higher
courts by precept or writ: and
that a precept to arrest hath these
formall words (<term lang="la">duci facias &#38;c</term>)
and a writ of attachment these
words: (<term lang="la">pr&#230;cipimus tibi quod atta&#173;
chies talem, &#38; habeas eum co&#173;
ram nobis &#38;c.</term> where by it appea&#173;
reth, that he which arresteth, ca&#173;
rieth the party arrested to ano&#173;
ther higher person to be dispo&#173;
sed of forth with, he that attach&#173;
eth, keepeth the party attached,
and presenteth him in court at
the day assigned in attachement.
yet I obserue out of Master Kit&#173;
chin , that an attachement issueth
out of a court baron, which is a
lowe court. cap: Attachment in
court baron, fo. 79. Another dif&#173;
ference there is, that an arrest li&#173;
eth onely vpon the body of a
man, and an attachement some
time vpon his good, as shalbe
shewed in the sequele. It may be
likewise asked how an attache&#173;
ment and a (<term lang="la">capias</term>) doe differ: &#38;
how an attachement and a  (<term lang="la">cape</term>)
and an attachement and a di&#173;
stresse. First that an attachement
differeth from a (<term lang="la">capias</term>) it appea&#173;
reth by Kitchin in these words: fo.
79. Note that in a court Baron a
man shalbe attached by his
goods; and a (<term lang="la">capias</term>) shall not
goe out thence. wherby I gather,
that an attachement is more
generall, taking hold of a mans
goods, and a (<term lang="la">capias</term>) of his body
onely. Then an attachement dif&#173;
fereth from a (<term lang="la">cape</term>) in this, be&#173;
cause a (<term lang="la">cape</term>) be it (<term lang="la">cape magnum</term>)
or (<term lang="la">cape parvum</term>) taketh hold of
immoveables, as lands or tene&#173;
ments, and are properly belon&#173;
ging to action reall: as you may
gather out of their formes, in
Fitzh. nat. br. whereas attache&#173;
m<expan type="">en</expan>t hath rather place in actions
personall, as Bracton plainly set&#173;
teth, downe. li. 4. tract a. 4. ca. 5. nu.
3. Where neuerthelesse it appea&#173;
reth that a (<term lang="la">cape</term>) may be likewise
vsed in an action personall. An
attachement (as it is formerly
said) taketh hold of moueable
goods or the bodie. For it appea&#173;
reth, by Kitchin. fo. 263. that a
man may be attached by a hun&#173;
dred sheepe. Reade Skene, <term lang="la">de ver&#173;

Now it followeth to shew
how attachement differeth from
a distresse. For so it doth, as may
be shewed out of Kitchin, fo. 78.

<page sig="F3v">
where he saith, that processe in

ment, and distresse, out of the

that a processe in a (<term lang="la">quare impedit</term>)
is summons, attachement, and
one distresse, and, againe fo. 28.
wheare (speaking of the writ) <term lang="la">ne

processe is one prohibition, and
vpon the prohibition an attach&#173;

these words: and after the attach&#173;

goe out of the rols of the Iustices.
Bracton on the other side, li. 5.
tract. 3. ca. 4. nu. 2. sheweth, that
both (<term lang="la">attachiamentum, &#38; mag&#173;
num cape, districtiones sunt</term>) . of
which opinion Fleta also is, li. 5.
ca. 24. &#167;. si autem ad. But there al&#173;
so he saith, that (<term lang="la">attachiamentum
est districtio personalis, &#38; cape mag&#173;
num districtio realis.</term> So that by his
opinion, <term lang="la">districtio is (genus)</term> to at&#173;
tachement. Britton in his 26.
chapter, hath words to this
effect: but in attachement of fe&#173;
lony, there commeth no distresse,
otherwise then by the body. And
if the Shyreeue return in the ca&#173;
ses aforefaid, that the trespas&#173;
sours haue nothing in his bayli&#173;
wick, by the which they may be
distreined, it must be awarded
that he take their bodies, &#38;c. In
which place, an attachement is
plainly vsed, for an apprehension
of an offender by his goods. So
that to conclude, I finde no dif&#173;
ference between an attachment,
and a distresse, but these two;
that an attachement reacheth
not to lands, as a distresse doth,
and that a distresse toucheth
not the bodie (if it be properly
taken) as an attachement doth.
yet are they diuers times con&#173;
founded, as may appeare by the
places formery alleadged, and
by Glanvile. li. 10. ca. 3. and Fleta.
li. 2. ca. 66. &#38; seqq. How be it, in
the most common vse, an attach&#173;
ment is an appreh<expan type="">en</expan>sion of a man
by his body, to bring him to an&#173;
swer the action of the plaintiffe:
a distresse is the taking of ano&#173;
ther mans goods, for some reall
cause, as rent, seruice, or such like,
whereby to driue him to reple&#173;
vie, and so to be plaintiffe in an
action of trespas, against him
that distreined him. And so much
for the difference, and coher<expan type="">en</expan>cie
of these words. See also Distres.

This court of attachement see&#173;

therein no other authoritie, but
to receiue the attachements of
offenders against vert and veni&#173;

<term lang="la">anno</term> 2. &#38; 3. Edw. 6. cap. 33. And
I find by Stawnf. pl. cor. fol. 66.
that a man by our ancient lawes,
was said to be conuicted pre&#173;
sently vpon the verdict (guiltie)
but not to be attainted, vntill it
appeared that he was no clerke:
or being a clerke, and demanded
of his ordinarie, could not purge
himselfe. So that a man was not
attainted vpon conuiction, ex&#173;
cept he were no Clerke: and, in
one word, it appeareth, that at&#173;
tainder is larger then conuiction;
conuiction being onely by the
Iurie.

And attainder is not before
iudgement, Perkins Graunts. num.
27. 29. Yet it appeareth by
Stawnf. fol. 9. that conuiction is
called attainder sometime. For
there he saith, that the verdict of

taint a man: and so it is, Westm. pr.

points onely, which see in Crom&#173;
ptons Iustice of peace, fol. 49. a.
Yet is the name still in good e&#173;
steeme some other way. For the
chiefe Magistrates in diuers

Colchester , and such like. And a&#173;
gaine, there be certaine, to
whom the kings castels be com&#173;
mitted, which are called Bailifs,
as the Bailiffe of Dover castell.

These ordinary bayliffes are of
two sorts: baylifs errant, and
baylifs of franchises. Baylifes er&#173;
rant (<term lang="la">bailivi itinerantes</term>) be those,
which the Shyreeue maketh, and
appointeth to goe hither &#38; thi&#173;
ther in the countie to serue writs,
to summon the countie, sessions,
assises, and such like. Baylifs of
franchises (<term lang="la">ballivi franchesiarum
aut libertatum</term>) be those, that are
appointed by euerie lord within
his libertie, to doe such offices
within his precincts, as the bay&#173;
life errant doth at large in the
countie. Of these read S. Thomas
Smith de repub. Anglo. li. 2. ca. 16.
There be also baylifes of the fo&#173;
rest. Manwood parte 1. pa. 113.
There be likewise baylifes of
husbandrie, belonging to priuate
men of great substance, who
seeme to be so called, by cause
they dispose of the vnder ser&#173;
vants every man to his
labour and taske, check them for
misdoing their buisenes, gather

ment, and sate as Nobles in the
vpper house. But when by expe&#173;
rience it appeared, that the Par&#173;
lament was too much pestered
with such multitudes: it grew to
a custome, that none shold come
but such, as the king, for their ex&#173;
traordinarie wisedome or quali&#173;
tie, thought good to call by writ;
which writ ranne (<term lang="la">hac vice tan&#173;
t&#249;m</term>.) After that againe men see&#173;
ing this estate of Nobilitie to be
but casuall, and to depend meer&#173;
ly vpon the Princes pleasure,
they sought a more certain hold,
and obtained of the King, leters
patents of this dignitie to them
and their heyres male. And these
were called Barons by leters
patents or by creation: whose
posterity, be now by inheritance
and true descent of Nobilitie,
those Barons that be called
Lords of the Parlament: of
which kind the king may create
more at his pleasure. It is thought
neuerthelesse, that there are yet
Barons by writ, as wel as Barons
by leters patents, and that they
may be discerned by their titles:
because the Barons by writ are
those, that to the title of Lord
haue their owne surnames anne&#173;
xed, as Compton, North, Norice ,
&#38;c. whereas the Barons by le&#173;
rers patents, are named by their
Baronies. These Barons which
were first by writ, may now iust&#173;
ly also be called Barons by pre&#173;
scription, for that they haue con&#173;
tinued Barons in themselues and
their auncestors time, beyond the
memorie of man. The originall
of Barons by writ Master Cam&#173;
den in his Britannia pag. 109. in

Barons by leters patents or cre&#173;

Abarre to a common intend&#173;

commenced in the Kings court,
against him that calleth another

the benefit of the King, for some
small yearely rent, and the per&#173;
formance of such seruices, as ori&#173;
ginally were laid vpon the land
at the donation thereof. For as
the king gaue to the great No&#173;
bles his immediat tenents, large
possessions for euer, to hold of
him for this or that rent and ser&#173;
uice: so they againe in time par&#173;
celled out to such as they liked,
their lands so receiued of the
kings bountie, for rents and ser&#173;
uices, as they thought good. And
these seruices are all by Litleton
diuided into two sorts: chivalry,
and socage. The one is martiall
and military, the other clownish
and rusticall. Chivalrie therefore
is a tenure or seruice, whereby
the tenent is bound to performe
some noble or military office vn&#173;
to his Lord, and is of two sorts:
either regall, that is, such as may
hold onely of the king: or such
as may also hold of a common
person, as well as of the king.
That which may hold onely
of the King, is properly called
<term lang="la">servitium</term> , or <term lang="la">sergeantia</term> : and is a&#173;

either him selfe, or to send a suf&#173;
ficient man in his place, there to
be maintained at his cost so ma&#173;
ny dates, as were agreed vpon
betweene the lord and his first
tenent at the graunting of the
see. And the daies of such seruice
seeme to haue bene rated by the
quantity of the land so houlden:
as if it extend to a whole knights
fee, then the tenent was bounde
thus to follow his lord fourty
dayes. And a knights fee, was so
much land, as in those dayes was
accoumpted a sufficient liuing
for a knight: and that was 680
acres, as some opinion is, or 800

Coke li. 4. fo. 37. thus expresseth:
Common appendant, by the
auncient lawe, had beginning
in this maner, when a lord in&#173;
feoffed another in erable lands,
to hould of him in socage (<term lang="la">id est,
per seruicium soc&#230;</term>) as all tenure
in the beginning (according to
Litleton) was: the feoffee, to
maintaine the seruice of his
plough, had comm<expan type="">on</expan> in the wasts
of his Iord, for his necessary
beasts to gaine and compas his
land: &#38; that for two causes: one
for that, as then it was taken, it
was (<term lang="la">tacit&#232;</term>) implyed in the feof&#173;
ment, by reason the feoffee could
not gaine or compas his land
without catell, and catell could
not be sustained without pas&#173;
ture. anb so by consequent the
feoffee had (as a thing necessary
and incident) common in the
wastes and land of the lord. And
this appeareth by aunci<expan type="">en</expan>t books
tempore. Ed. i. tit. common 24. &#38;

right Honorable and learned

the same court plainely proueth,
was and is parcell of the kings
most Honorable Councell, and
so alwaies called and esteemed.
The Iudges thereof were alwaies
of the kings most Honourable
Councell, appointed by the king
to keepe his Councell board. The
keeping of this court was neuer
tyed to any place certaine, but
onely where the Councell sate,
the suyters were to attend. But
now of late for the ease of sui&#173;
ters, it hath bene kept in the
White hall at Westminster , and
onely in the Tearme time. It is a
court of Record, wherein recog&#173;
nizances are also taken by the
kings Councell. The forme of
proceeding in this court, was al&#173;
together according to the pro&#173;
cesse of summarie causes in the
ciuile lawe. The persons plain&#173;
tiffes and defendants, were al&#173;

or as necessarie attendants of
them: or else where the plain&#173;

state was not matchable with
the wealth or greatnesse of the
defendant: or where the cause
meerely contained mater of
equitie, and had no proper
remedie at the common law:
or where it was specially re&#173;
commended from the king
to the examination of his
Councell: or concerned Vni&#173;
uersities, Colledges, Hospitals,
and the like. The causes wher&#173;

they iudge, are of all sortes:
as maritime, vltra marine, eccle&#173;
siasticall, temporall; but pro&#173;
perly temporall causes, and
onely of the other sort, as
they are mixt with temporal.
The maner of proceeding in
the said court, is first, by pri&#173;
vie seale, leters missiue, or
Iniunction, or messenger, or
bond. Secondly, by attache&#173;
ment. Thirdly, by proclamati&#173;

these words of that booke: This

then it lieth in case, where deceit
is made to a man by another,
by which deceit he may be dis&#173;
herited, or otherwise euill intrea&#173;

that he warne a man to be be&#173;

the partie that sieweth the (<term lang="la">scire

saith that the originall writ of
deceite lieth, where any deceit
is done to a man by another, so

find mention of these, as in Brit&#173;
ton cap. 12. who saith in the
kings person (as he writeth his
whole booke) in this maner: We
will, that all those which be 14.
yeares old, shall make oath, that
they shall be sufficient and loyall
vnto vs, and that they will be

except religious persons, clerks,

and women. Yet the same au&#173;
thor in his 29. chapter, some
thing toward the end, doth say,
that all of 12. yeares old and
vpward, are punishable for not
comming to the Turne of the

Barons, religious persons, and
women. Stawnf. pl. cor. fol. 37.
out of Fitzh. hath these wordes:
The like lawe is, where the do&#173;
zeniers make presentment, that
a felon is taken for felonie, and
deliuered to the Shyreeue, &#38;c.
And Kitchin , out of the Register,
and Britton , saith thus. Religious
persons, clerkes, knights, or wo&#173;
men shall not be deceniers.
fol. 33. So that hereby I gather,
that of later times, this word sig&#173;
nifieth nothing but such an one,
as by his oath of loyaltie to his
Prince, (for suretie none ordina&#173;
rily findeth at these dayes) is set&#173;

the application of this speech to

Britton. cap. 78. sheweth, that this

sometime more largely, as of

to Franck fee. For example,
those lands, which were in the

Demaine, &#38; all others be called
Franck fee. Kitchin. fol : 98. and
the tenents which hould any of

nents in franck fee. Kitchin vbi
supra. And also tenents at the
common lawe. West. parte 2.
Simbol: titulo Fines. Sect 25. The
reason is, because tenents in

syewed out of the Lords court:

ex<expan type="">am</expan>ple: Smith de rep. Anglo. p. 105.
calleth the later a dowrie , and
dower is sometime vsed for the
former: as in Britton vbi supra.
yet were it not inconuenient to
distinguish them being so diuers.
The Civilians call the former
(<term lang="la">dotem</term>) and the later (<term lang="la">donationem
propter nuptias</term>.) Of the former
the common law bookes speake
very litle. This onely is to be no&#173;
ted, that whereas by the ciuile
lawe, instruments are made be&#173;
fore mariage, which containe
the quantitie of the wiues dow&#173;
rie, or substance brought to her
husband, that he hauing the vse
of it, during mariage, may, after
certaine deductions, restore it a&#173;
gaine to his wiues heires or
friends, after the mariage dissol&#173;
ued: the common lawe of En&#173;
gland , whatsoeuer chatels moue&#173;
able or immoueable, or readie
money she bringeth, doth make
them foorthwith her husbands
owne, to be disposed of, as he
will, leauing her at his courtesie,
to bestow any thing or nothing
of her at his death. The reason
whereof is said to be, the holding
of the wife in obedience to her
husband. Onely if she be an in&#173;
heretrice, her husband holdeth
the land but during her life, ex&#173;
cept he haue issue by her: but
then he holdeth it by the courte&#173;
sie of England during his owne
life. See Courtesie. And againe,
if he haue any land in fee, wher&#173;
of he was possessed during the
mariage, she is to haue a third
therof during her life, though she
bring nothing to him, except
she doe by fine release her right,
during the mariage. So that
here is no great mater to bee
spoken of, but touching dower in
the later signification. You must
know therfore, that vpon speech
of mariage betweene two, the
parents of both sides are com&#173;

the possessions, liberties, &#38;c. of
the said Dutchy were seuered
from the Crowne: Yet Henry
the 7. reduced it to his former
nature, as it was in Henry the
fifts daies. Crompton Iurisdict. fol.
136. The officers belonging to
this Court are the Chauncellour,
the Atturney, Receiuer generall,
Clerke of the court, the Messen&#173;

Assistantes of this Court: as one
Atturney in the Exchequer: one
Atturney of the Dutchy in the
Chauncery, foure learned men
in the lawe, reteined of councell
with the King in the said court.
Of this Court M. Gwin. in the
preface to his readings thus
speaketh: The court of the Du&#173;
chy (or Countie Palatine of Lan&#173;
caster) grew out of the graunt of
king Edward the third, who first
gaue the Dutchy to his sonne
Iohn of Gawnte , and endowed it
with such royall right, as the
Countie Palatine of Chester
had: and for as much, as it was
afterward extinct in the person
of king Henry the fourth, by
reason of the vnion of it with
the Crowne: the same king
suspecting himselfe to bee more
rightfully Duke of Lancaster , then
king of England, determined to
saue his right in the Dutchy , what&#173;
soeuer should befal of the King&#173;
dome: and therefore hee separa&#173;
ted the Dutchy from the
Crowne, and setled it so in the
naturall persons of himselfe and
his heires, as if he had bin no
king or Politique bodie at all: In
which plight it continued, du&#173;
ring the reigne of K. Henry the
5. and Henry the 6. that were des&#173;
cended of him. But when King
Edw. the 4. had (by recouery of
the Crowne) recontinued the
right of the house of Yorke , hee
feared not to appropriate that
Dutchy to the Crowne againe:
and yet so, that hee suffered the
Court and Officers to remaine
as he founde them. And in this
maner, it came together with the
Crowne, to King Henry the 7.
who liking well of that policy
of King H. the 4. (by whose right
also hee obteined the Kingdome)
made like separation of the Dut&#173;

it to his posterity which doe yet

by their charters, of this or that
Countie, giuing them no autho&#173;

the Shyreeue is called Vicecomes ,

Earle is most commonly atten&#173;

that Earles by reason of their

Who there sheweth for what
things it lyeth, and for what it

114. chapter writeth to this
effect. The writs of entrie sauour
much of the right of propertie.
As for example: some be to reco&#173;
uer customes and seruices: in the
which are contained these twoe
words (<term lang="la">solet &#38; debet</term>) as the writs
<term lang="la">Quo iure, Rationabilibus diuisis, ra&#173;
tionabili estoverio</term> , with such like.
And in this plee of entrie there
be three degrees: The first is,
where a man demandeth landes
or tenements of his owne seisin,
after the terme is expired. The
second is, where one demaun&#173;
deth lands or tenements let by
another after the terme expired.
The third, where one demaun&#173;
deth lands or tenements of that
tenent, that had entry by one, to
whom some auncestor of the
plaintife did let it for a term now
expired. According to which
degrees the writs for more fit re&#173;
medie are varied. And there is
yet a fourth forme, which is
without the degrees, and in
case of a more remote seisin,
whereunto the other three de&#173;
grees do not extend. The writ in
the second degree is called a
writ of entrie <term lang="la">in le per</term> : and a writ
in the third degree is called a
writ of entrie <term lang="la">in le per &#38; cui</term> : and
the fourth forme without these
degrees, is called a writ of entry
<term lang="la">in le post</term> , that is to say, after
the disseisin which such a one
made to such a one. And if
any writ of entry be con&#173;
ceiued out of the right case, so
that one forme be brought for
another, it is abatable. The form
of the first degree is such. <term lang="la">Pr&#230;ci&#173;

take those words, that we vse
for the expressing of our deepest
right in any lands or tenements,
to import: for he that can say
most for his estate, saith thus: I
am seised of this or that land or

fee. <term lang="la">Seisitus inde in dominico meo vt

tute <term lang="la">anno</term> 37. H. 8. ca. 16. vseth
these words of lands invested in
the crowne: but it proceedeth
from the ignorance of the na&#173;
ture of this word (fee) for fee
cannot be without fealty sworne
to a superiour, as you may reade
partly in the word (Fealtie) but
more at large in those that
write de feudis : and namely Hoto&#173;
man , both in his commentaries

may graunt, that our king or
Crowne oweth fealty to any su&#173;
perior but God onely. Yet it
may be said, that land, &#38;c. with
vs is termed fee in two respects;
one, as it belongeth to vs and our
heires for ever: and so may the
Crowne land be called Fee: the
other, as it holdeth of another,
which is and must be farre from
our Crowne. Britton ca. 32. defi&#173;
neth fee to this effect. Fee is a
right consisting in the person of

it. Fleta saith that <term lang="la">Feudum est

in diuers respects are many, and
those though little knowne to
vs in England, yet better wor&#173;
thie to be known, then we com&#173;
monly thinke. But for our pre&#173;

uide Fee into two sorts: Fee abso&#173;
lute , otherwise called simple: and
Fee conditionall , otherwise ter&#173;
med fee tayle: Fee simple (<term lang="la">Feudum
simplex</term>) is that, whereof we are
seised in these generall words
(to vs and our heires for ever.)
Fee tayle (<term lang="la">Feudum talliatum</term>) is
that, whereof we are seized to
vs and our heires with limitati&#173;
on, that is, the heires of our
body, &#38;c. And fee taile is ei&#173;
ther generall or speciall.
Generall is, where land is giuen
to a man and the heires of his
body. The reason whereof is gi&#173;
uen by Litleton ca. 3. li 1. because
a man seised of land by such a
gift, if he marie one or more
wiues, and haue no issue by
them, and at the length marie
another, by whome he hath is&#173;
sue, this issue shall inherit the
land: Fee taile speciall is that,
where a man and his wife be
seised of lands to them, and the
heires of their two bodies. The
reason is likewise giuen by Litle&#173;
ton in the same place, because
in this case, the wife dying with&#173;
out issue, and he marying ano&#173;
ther, by whome he hath issue,
this issue, cannot inherit the
land, being specially giuen to
such heires, &#38;c. this Fee taile hath
the originall, from the statute

his originall vse. v. Wesemb. pa&#173;
rat. <term lang="la">titulo de transact</term>. For it ap&#173;
peareth by the writers of the
common lawe aboue named,
that it is nothing but a composi&#173;
tion or concord acknowledged
and recorded before a compe&#173;
tent Iudge, touching some he&#173;
reditament or thing immouea&#173;
ble, that earst was in controuer&#173;
sie betweene those, that be par&#173;
ties to the same concord: and
that for the better credit of the
transaction, being by imputation
made in the presence of the
king, because it is leuied in his
Court: and therefore doth it
bind women couert being par&#173;
ties, and others whom ordi&#173;
narily the lawe disableth to
transact, onely for this rea&#173;
son, that all presumption of
deceipt or euill meaning is exclu&#173;
ded, where the king is priuy
to the acte. But discourse of
wit and reason, hath in time
wrought other vses of this
concord, which in the begin&#173;
ning was but one: as namely, to
secure the title that any man
hath in his possession against
all men: to cut off intayles, and
with more certaintie to passe
the interest or the title of a&#173;
ny land or tenement, though
not controuerted, to whome
we thinke good, either for
yeares or in fee. In so much
that the passing of a fine,
in most cases, now is it but

kings licence giuing the parties
libertie to accord, for the which
he hath a fine called the Kings

deforciantes, &#38;c.</term> Fifthly, the foot
of the fine, which beginneth

&#224; die Pasch&#230; in quindecim dies, <term lang="la">anno</term>

includeth all, containing the day,
yeare, and place, and before
what Iustice the concord was
made. Coke vo. 6. casu Teye. fol. 38.
&#38; 39. This fine is either single or
double: A single fine, is that by
which nothing is graunted or
rendred backe againe by the
Cognizeese to the Cognizours,
or any of them. A double fine
containeth a graunt and render
backe againe, either of some
rent, common, or other thing,
out of the land, or of the land it
selfe, to all or some of the Cog&#173;
nizours, for some estate, limiting
thereby many times Remainders
to straungers, which be not
named in the writ of couenant.
West vbi supra, sect. 21. Againe, a
fine is of the effect, deuided into
a fine executed, and a fine execu&#173;
tory. A fine executed is such a
fine, as of his owne force giueth
a present possession (at the least
in law) vnto the Cognizee, so
that he needeth no writ of (<term lang="la">Ha&#173;
bere facias seisinam</term>) for the exe&#173;
cution of the same, but may en&#173;
ter; of which sort is a fine (<term lang="la">sur
cognizance de droit come ceo que il
ad de son done</term>) that is vpon ac&#173;
knowledgement, that the thing
mentioned in the concord be <term lang="la">ius
ipsius cognizati, vt illa qu&#230; idem ha&#173;
bet de dono Cognitoris.</term> West. sect.
51. K. and the reason of this see&#173;
meth to be, because this fine,
passeth by way of release of that
thing, which the cognizee hath
already (at the least by supposi&#173;
tion) by vertue of a former gift
of the cognizour. Cokes reports
li. 3. the case of fines fo. 89. b.
which is, in very deed, the surest
fine of all. <term lang="la">Fines executorie</term> be
such, as of their owne force doe
not execute the possession in the
Cognizeese, as <term lang="la">fines sur cognizan&#173;
ce de droit tant&#249;m. fines sur done</term> ,
graunt, release, confirmation, or
render. For if such fines be not le&#173;

them, that be in possession at the
time of the fines leuied, the cog&#173;
nizees must needs siew writs of
(<term lang="la">Habere facias seisinam</term>) accord&#173;
ing to their seuerall cases, for
the obtaining of their possessi&#173;
ons, except at the leuying of such
executory fines, the parties, vnto
whom the estate is by them limi&#173;
ted, be in possession of the lands
passed thereby: for in this case
such fines doe inure by way of
extinguishment of right, not al&#173;
tering the estate or possession of
the Cognizee, but perchaunce
bettring it. West. vbi supra, sect. 20.

Touching the forme of these
fines, it is to be considered vpon
what writ or action the concord
is to be made, and that is, most
commonly, vpon a writ of coue&#173;
nant: and then first there must
passe a paire of indentures be&#173;
tweene the Cognizour and Cog&#173;
nizee, whereby the Cognizour
couenanteth with the cognizee,
to passe a fine vnto him, of such
or such things by a day set down.
And these indentures, as they
are first in this proceeding, so are
they saide to lead the fine; vpon
this couenant, the writ of coue&#173;
nant is brought by the Cogni&#173;
zee against the cognizour, who
therevpon yeeldeth to passe the
fine before the Iudge, and so
the acknowledgement being re&#173;
corded, the cognizour and his
heires are presently concluded,
and all straungers not excepted,
after fiue yeares once passed. If
the writ wherevpon the fine is
grounded, be not a writ of coue&#173;
naunt, but of <term lang="la">warrantia chart&#230;</term> , or
a writ of right, or a writ of <term lang="la">mesn</term> ,
or a writ of custome and serui&#173;
ces (for of all these fines may al&#173;
so be founded. (West. vbi supra,
sect: 23.) then this forme is ob&#173;
serued: the writ is serued vpon
the party that is to acknowledge
the fine, and then he appearing
doth accordingly : See Dier, fo.
179. nu. 46.

This word (fine) sometime
signifieth a summe of money,
paide for an Income to lands or
tenements let by lease: some&#173;
time an amends, pecuniarie pu&#173;
nishment, or recompence vpon
an offence committed a&#173;
gainst the king and his lawes,
or a Lord of a maner. In which
case, a man is said <term lang="la">facere finem de
transgressione cum Rege, &#38;c. Regist.</term>
Iud. fol. 25. a. and of the diuersity
of these fines with other mater
worth the learning, see Cromp&#173;
tons Iustice of peace, fol. 141. b. 143.
144. and Lamberds Eirenarcha
libro. 4. ca 16. pa. 555. But in all
these diuersities of vses, it hath
but one signification; and that
is a finall conclusion or ende of

chace, and warren, to rest and a&#173;

though it haue many superflui&#173;

ture of the thing, especially the
explication adioyned, which
there is set downe by the said
author in both places in his first
part. pag. 16. where he fetcheth
a forest from such overgrowne
antiquitie, alledging for it the
second booke of Kings, ca. 2. ver.

104. psalme vers. 20. the 131. ver.

selfe. for though our english

desert, yet if we looke to the o&#173;
riginall Idiome, we shall finde no
more reason to call those places
forests, th<expan type="">en</expan> either chases or parks.

The maner of making fo&#173;
rests, as the same author well set&#173;
teth downe, parte. 1. pag. 142. is
this. The king sendeth out his

that none shal hunt or chace any
maner of wilde bests within that
precinct, without the kings spe&#173;
ciall licence, after which he ap&#173;
pointeth ordinances, lawes, and
officers, fit for the preseruation
of the vert and venison: and so
becommeth this a forest by ma&#173;
ter of record. The properties of a
forest are these in speciall, first, a
forest, as it is truly and strictly
taken, cannot be in the hands of
any but the king: the reason is
giuen by M. Manwood , because
none hath power to graunt com&#173;

the forest, but the king. parte. 1.

For the auncient custome of En&#173;

publique peace, was that euery
free borne man, at fourteene
yeares of age, after Bracton (reli&#173;
gious persons, clerks, knights,
and their eldest sonnes excepted)
should finde suerty for his truth
toward the King and his sub&#173;
iects, or else be kept in prison,
whereupon a certaine number
of neighbours became customa&#173;
bly bound one for another, to
see each man of their pledge
forthcomming at all times, or to
answere the transgression com&#173;
mitted by any broken away. So
that whosoeuer offended, it was
forthwith inquired in what
pledge he was, and then they of
that pledge, either brought him
forth within 31. daies to his aun&#173;
swere, or satisfied for his offence.
This was called Frank pledge,
<term lang="la">causa qua supra</term>. and the circuit
thereof was called <term lang="la">Decenna</term> , be&#173;
cause it commonly consisted of
10. houshouldes: And euery par&#173;

bound for himselfe and his
neighbours, was called <term lang="la">Decenni&#173;

na</term> or another: This custome was
so kept, that the shyreeues, at
euery county court, did from
time to time take the oaths of
yonge ones, as they grew to the
age of 14. yeares, and see, that
he were combined in one dozen

But by the course and custome

maior or minor: the greater con&#173;
taines all titles and degrees from
Knights vpward: the lesser all
from Barons downward. Smith
vbi supra. cap. 21. The reason of
the name, as I take it, groweth
from this, that they obserue <term lang="la">gen&#173;

propagation of their blood, by
giuing of armes, which the c<expan type="">om</expan>&#173;

hariot. nu. 5. Hariot after the
death of the tenent for life, is
hariot custome. For hariot ser&#173;
vice is after the death of tenent
in fee-simple. The new Expoun&#173;
der of the lawe termes saith,
that hariot seruice (in some mans
opinion) is often expressed in a
mans graunt or deed, that hee
holdeth by such seruice to pay
hariot at the time of his death,
that holdeth in fee simple. Hariot
custome is, where hariots haue bin
payed time out of mind by cu&#173;
stome. And this may be after the
death of the tenent for life. See
Plowden. fol. 95. b. 69. a. b.
Bracton saith, that heriotum, est

By our lawe a religious man may

they haue ioyned issue, which
shalbe tried or is tried by a Iury
or inquest: and this pleading or
issue is so badly pleaded or ioy&#173;

proceed: then some of the said

defects before the Iury charged,
was often when the Iury came

shew it, shall say: this inquest
you ought not to take, and if it
be after verdict, then he may say.
to Iudgement you ought not to
goe: and because of this many
delayes grew in suites, diuers sta&#173;

finde it, so passeth the Iudge&#173;

by this the King sheweth to his

of other nations, you may reade
in Glanuil. lib: 2: cap : 7. where he
called it <term lang="la">Regale beneficium cle&#173;

they doe it by the same maner.

this Iury, though it appertaine

the half yeare courts of the Iusti&#173;

the great assises, and in the quar&#173;

most ordinarily called a Iurie.

tearmed an enquest, and in the

generall Assise there are vsually
many Iuries, bicause there be

such as they doe approoue, if

which, iudgement passeth after&#173;

from this, because in respect
of their beter expedition, a
man is supposed to lurke, and
therefore being serued with this

sit latitare. <term lang="gk">&#x03C0;</term>. Quibus ex
causis in possessionem eatur</term> : But
to vnderstand the true original
of this writ, it is to be knowne,
that in auncient time, whilest the
kings bench was moueable, and
followed the court of the King,
the custome was, when any man
was to be siewed, to send forth
a writ to the Shyreeue of the
county where the Court lay, for
the calling him in: and if the
Shyreeue returned, <term lang="la">non est in&#173;
ventus in baliva nostra, &#38;c.</term> then
was there a second writ procured
foorth, that had these words,
(<term lang="la">testatum est eum latitare, &#38;c.</term>)
and thereby the Shyreeue wil&#173;
led to attach him in any other
place where he might be found.
Now when the tribunall of the
Kings bench came to be setled
at Westminster , the former course
of writ was kept for a long
time, first sending to the Shy&#173;
reeue of Midlesex to summon
the party, and if he could not be
found there, then next to appre&#173;
hend him wheresoeuer. But
this seeming too troublesome
for the subiect, it was at last de&#173;
uised, to put both these writs in&#173;
to one, and so originally to
attache the party complained
of vpon a supposall or fiction,
that he was not within the coun&#173;
ty of Middlesex , but lurking else
where, and that therefore he
was to be apprehended in any
place else, where he was presu&#173;
med to lye hidden, by a writ di&#173;
rected to the Shyreeue of the
county where he is suspected to
be: and by this writ a man being
brought in, is committed to the
Marshall of that court, in whose
custodie when he is, then by
reason he is in the same countie
where the Kings bench is, he
may be siewed vpon an action
in that court, wheras the original
cause of apprehending him
must be a pretence of some de&#173;
ceit or contempt committed,
which most properly of old
belonged to the cognizance of
that court. I haue bene enfor&#173;
med, that the bringing of these
actions of trespas so ordinarily
to the kings bench, was an inuen&#173;
tion of Councelers, that because
onely Sergeants may come to
the common plees barre, found
a meanes to set themselues on
worke in that court. The forme
of this writ is such : <term lang="la">Iacobus Dei

Henry the sixth directing his

of Warwicke , thereby to dis&#173;
charge him of the Captain&#173;

sed to obey the priuie seale,
and continued forth the said
office, because he receiued it by
Parlament. But one example
cannot make good a doctrine.
And of these two one must
needes be true, that either the
king is aboue the Parlament,
that is, the positiue lawes
of his kingdome, or els that
he is not an absolute king.

And therefore though it be a

make lawes by the consent
of the whole Realme, be&#173;
cause so no one part shall
haue cause to complaine of a

weare repugnant to the nature

is the common lineall measure,

broade, make a square and su&#173;

And it is to be vnderstood, that
one rod, one raip, one lineall fall
of measure, are all one, for each
one of them containeth sixe

is a staffe or pole of wood, a
raipe is made of tow or hempe.
And so much land as falleth vn&#173;
der the rod or raipe at once, is
called a fal of measure, or a lineal
fall: because it is the measure of

the superficiall fall is the mea&#173;

the which, and none other
fountaine, all ecclesiasticall Iu&#173;

as in truth Sir Tho. Smith saith ve&#173;

diction is now deriued, and the
maintenance whereof was by
those Princes especially pur&#173;
posed. But of this reade Sir
Thomas Smith, lib. 3. de Rep. Angl.
cap. 9.

Some later statutes doe cast
this punishment vpon other of&#173;
fenders: as namely the statute,
<term lang="la">anno</term> 1. El. cap. primo , vpon him
that denieth the Kings suprema&#173;
cie the second time, &#38;c. and the
statue <term lang="la">anno</term> 13. El. ca. 2. vpon him
that affirmeth the authoritie of

and the statute, <term lang="la">anno</term> 13. El. cap. 1.
such as be seditious talkers of
the inheritance of the Crowne,
or affirme the Queenes Maiestie






</page>

<page sig="Ddd3r">
to be an heritique. And the
word is applied most common&#173;
ly to the punishment first or&#173;
deined by the statutes before
mentioned, for such as trans&#173;
gressed them; but in later times
imposed vpon other offences.
for that, where it is saide that a&#173;
ny man for an offence commit&#173;
ted shall incurre a premunire, it
is meant, that he shall incurre
the same punishment, which
is inflicted against those that
trangresse the statute made, <term lang="la">anno</term>
16. R. 2. ca. 5. which is common&#173;
ly called the statute of premu&#173;

not vnusuall in our statutes. <emend err="C">F</emend> or

doe by that statute forbid flesh

be punished as they be, which
be spredders of false newes: ha&#173;
uing reference thereby to those
statutes, which conteine the pu&#173;
nishment of such offenders.

Now touching the Etymolo&#173;
gie of this word (Pr&#230;munire)
some thinke it proceedeth from
the strength giuen to the Crown
by the former statutes, against
the vsurpation of forein and vn&#173;
naturall power: which opinion
may receiue some ground from
the statute, <term lang="la">anno</term> 2 5. Ed. 3. stat. 6.
cap. pri. But other thinke it to
grow from the verb (<term lang="la">Pr&#230;monere</term>)
being barbarously turned into
(Pr&#230;munire) which corruption is
taken from the rude Interpre&#173;
ters of the Ciuile, and Canon
lawes, who indeede doe vse the
effect (Pr&#230;munire) many times
for the efficient cause (<term lang="la">Pr&#230;mone&#173;
re</term>) according to our prouerb:
He that is well warned, is halfe
armed. And of this I gather rea&#173;

2. By this it appeareth, that the

made, an. 17. Ed. 2. conteineth
not the summe of the Kings
whole prerogatiue, but onely
so much thereof, as concernes
the profit of his cofers growing
by vertue of his regall power
and crowne. for it is more then
manifest, that his prerogatiue
reacheth much farder: yea euen
in the maters of his profit,
which that statute especially
consisteth of. For example, it is
the kings prerogatiue to graunt
protection vnto his debtours a&#173;
gainst other creditours, vntill
himselfe be satisfied. Fitzh. nat.

Coke. li. 4. fo. 7 3. a. Now for those
regalities which are of the high&#173;
er nature (all being within the
compas of his prerogatiue, and
iustly to be comprised vnder
that title) there is not one that
belonged to the most absolute
prince in the world, which doth
not also belong to our king, ex&#173;
cept the custome of the nations
so differ (as indeede they doe)
that one thing be in the one ac&#173;
compted a regalitie, that in an&#173;
other is none. Onely by the cu&#173;
stome of this kingdome, he
maketh no lawes without the
consent of the 3. estates though
he may quash any lawe conclu&#173;
ded of by them. And whether
his power of making lawes be
restreined (<term lang="la">de necessitate</term>) or of a
godly and commendable policy,
not to be altered without great
perill, I leaue to the iudgement
of wiser men. But I hold it in&#173;
controwlable, that the king of
England is an absolute king.
And all learned politicians doe
range the power of making
lawes, <term lang="la">inter insignia summ&#230; &#38; ab&#173;

they may be the more easily com&#173;
pared with our kings preroga&#173;
tiues, and so the differences no&#173;
ted betweene vs and them. And
whereas some things are before
reckoned both (<term lang="la">inter regalia ma&#173;
iora, &#38; minora</term>) the reader must
vnderstand that this may be in
diuers respects. For example, the
power of raising a tribute, or of
coyning money is <term lang="la">inter maiora</term> :
but the profit that groweth to
the Prince by the one or other, is
(<term lang="la">inter minora</term>) Now may there al&#173;
so be noted out of books a great
number of prerogatiues belon&#173;
ging to the king of this land,
which doe not bring profit to
his cofers immediately, and
therefore may be accoumpted
<term lang="la">inter regalia maiora</term> , or at the
least, in a middle or mixt
nature, or <term lang="la">inter maiora &#38; minora</term> ,
because by a consequent they
tend to the increase of the kings

haue obserued in reading, I will
set downe as they come to my

out of any part of his prouince,
though not appealed. But this
point is now limited by the Sta&#173;

The receyuing of an appeale
from the lowest Iudge ecclesi&#173;

him: as Visitation, Institution to
Benefices, and such like.

The visitation of euery Dio&#173;

&#38; in what order it pleaseth him.
As also of all other priuiledged
Churches. The probate of Testa&#173;

tenne pounds.

The probate of euery Bishops

<wordentry type="h"><form lang="en" lexeme="prescription(n)">Prescription (<term lang="la">pr&#230;scriptio</term>)</form> <xpln lang="en">is a
course or vse of any thing for a
time beyond the memory of
man, as the exposition of the law
terms doth define it. Kitchin fol.
104. saith thus: Prescription is,
when for continuance of time,
whereof there groweth no me&#173;
mory, a perticuler person hath
perticuler right against another
perticuler person. And custome
is, where by continuance of
time beyond memorie, diuers
persons haue gotten a right:
with whome agreeth Sir Edward
Cooke, lib. 4. fol. 32. a. And v&#173;
sage is by continuance of time
the efficient cause of them both,
and the life of both prescription
and custome. Thus saith Kit&#173;
chin. But as in the Ciuill lawe, so
I think likewise in the common,
Prescription may be in a shorter
time. As for example, where the
<emend err="Satute">Statute</emend> <term lang="la">anno</term> , 1. H. 8. cap. 9. saith,
that all actions popular must be
siewed within three yeares after
the offence committed, and the
Statute <term lang="la">anno</term> , 7. einsdem. cap. 3.
That foure yeares being past af&#173;
ter the offence committed in one
case, and one yeare in another,
no suite can be commenced, and
the Statute 31. Eliz. cap. 5. saith,
(by way of correcting the two
former statutes) that all actions,
&#38;c. brought vpon any Sta&#173;
tute, the penaltie whereof be&#173;
longeth to the King, shall be
brought within two yeares after
the offence committed, or else be
voide. And the S <emend err="">t</emend>atute, <term lang="la">anno</term> 39.
Eliz. cap. prim. &#38; secund. saith,
that actions brought after two
yeare by any common person,
or after three yeares by the king
alone for decay of husbandry
or tillage, shall bee of noe
force. Whosoeuer offendeth
against any such Statute, and
doth escape vncalled for two
yeares, or three yeares, in one
case of the two later of these
three Statutes, may iustly be
said to haue prescribed an im&#173;
munitie against that action. The
like may be said of the Sta&#173;
tute made <term lang="la">anno</term> 2 3. Eliz. cap.
primo. which saith, that all of&#173;
fences comprised in the Statute
made in the 13. yeere of Eliz.
cap. 2. are inquirable before both
Iustices of peace and of Assise,
within one yeare and a day, af&#173;
ter the offence committed. Also
the title that a man obtaineth
by the passing of fiue yeares
after a fine acknowledged of
any lands or tenements, may






</page>

<page sig="Eee2v">
iustly be said to be obtained by
prescription. And whereas the
Statute, <term lang="la">anno</term> 8. R. 2. cap. 4. saith,
that a Iudge or Clerke convi&#173;
cted for false entring of plees,
&#38;c. may be fined within two
yeares; the two yeares being
ended, he prescribeth against
the punishment of the saide
Statute; and whereas the Sta&#173;
tute <term lang="la">anno</term> 11. H. 7. saith, that
he which will complaine of
maintenance, or embracery,
whereby periurie is commit&#173;

within sixe dayes, those sixe
daies ended, the parties pre&#173;

man being not indicted within 3
monethes of any offences there
mentioned touching Seruice and
Sacraments, he shalbe cleare

monethes being ended, he pre&#173;
scribeth: And the same may be
said of the statute <term lang="la">anno</term> 5. Ed. 6.
cap. 5. which saith that a man
shall not be indited of any

wordes to this effect. The record
of the Kings Court, is a record
of things done before the King.
All things done before the King,

This record may he and other
make: if he himselfe will not

two: the former, because his pa&#173;

cause he is a conseruatour of the

this formality there be required
3. parties, viz. the Demaundant,
the Tenent, and the Vowchee.
The Demaundant is he that
bringeth the writ of Entrie, and
may be termed the Recouerer:
The Tenent is he, against whom
the writ is brought, and may be
termed the Recoveree. The

West. vbi supra. In whom you
may reade more touching this

But for example to explane
this point, a man that is desirous
to cut of an estate tayle in lands
or tenements, to the end, to sell,
giue, or bequeath it, as him self
seeth good, vseth his frend to
bring a writ vpon him for this
land. He appearing to the writ
saith for him <emend err="f">s</emend>elfe, that the
land in question came to him or
his auncesters from such a man
or his auncester, who in the
conueiance thereof, bound him
selfe and his heires to make
good the title vnto him or them
to whome it was conueied. And
so he is allowed by the court to
call in this third man to say
what he can for the iustifiing
of his right to this land, before
he so conveied it. The third
man commeth not: wherevpon
the land is recouered by him
that brought the writ: and the
tenent of the land is left for
his remedie to the third man
that was called and came not
in to defend the tenent. And by
this meanes the entayle which
was made by the tenent,
or his auncester, is cut of by
iudgement herevpon giuen: for
that he is pretended to haue no
power to entaile that land,
wherevnto he had no iust title,
as now it appeareth: because it






</page>

<page sig="Iii4r">
is evicted, or recouered from
him.

This kinde of recouery is by
good opinion, but a snare to de&#173;
ceiue the people. Doctor &#38; Stud.
ca. 32. dial. pri. fol. 56. a. This
feigned Recouery is also called a
common Recouery: And the
reason of that <term lang="la">Epitheton</term> is, be&#173;

is ordeined, viz. to cut of the e&#173;
states aboue specified. See the
new booke of Entries <term lang="la">verbo</term>. Reco&#173;

I saide before, that a true
recouery is as well of the value,
as of the thing: for the beter
vnderstanding whereof, know,
that (In valew) signifieth as much
as (<term lang="la">Illud quod interest</term>) with the
Ciuilians. For example, if a
man buy land of an other with
warranty, which land a third
person afterward by suite of
lawe recouereth against me, I
haue my remedie against him
that sould it me, to recouer in

necessity before that any such
sessions or Iustices seate can be
houlden, the Regarders of the

And this making of the Regard
must be done by the kings writ.
And the Regard is, (as he after&#173;

the whole Forest, and euery

Rent seruice, Rent charge, and
Rent seck. Rent seruice is, where

summe of money yearely to
be paide vnto him with clause
of distresse, or to him and his

Lamberd thus saith of it: A
Route is the same, which the

a band or great companie of
men gathered together, and
going about to execute, or ex&#173;
ecuting indeed, any ryot or vn&#173;
lawfull act: and (saith more) it
is said properly of the multitude
that assembleth themselues in
such disorderly sort, for their
common quarels. As if the in&#173;
habitants of a towneship doe
assemble to pull downe a hedge,
or pale, to haue their common,
where they ought to haue none,
or to beate a man, that hath done
them some publike offence or
displeasure. But the statute of
18. Ed. 3. stat. prim. cap. vnico.

<term lang="la">titulo</term> Riot. 4. &#38; 5. So (as it see&#173;
meth) a route should be a speci&#173;
all kind of vnlawfull assembly:
and a riot the disorderly fact
committed generally by any vn&#173;
lawfull assembly. Howsoeuer it
be, two things are common
both to Riot, Route, and vn&#173;
lawfull assembly: the one, that
three persons at the least bee
gathered together: for so it is
commonly taken at this day,
as I haue learned: the other,
that they being together, do
breed disturbance of the peace,
either by signification of speech,
shew of armour, turbulent ge&#173;
sture, or actuall and expresse
violence: so that either the
peaceable sort of men be vn&#173;
quieted, and feared by the
fact, or the lighter sort, and
busie bodies emboldened by the
example. Thus farre M. Lam&#173;

cton lib. 2. cap. 8. num. 3. The old.
nat. br. fol. 94. maketh three
parts of this diuision. viz. Soc&#173;
cage of free tenure, Soccage of
auncient tenure, and soccage of
base tenure. soccage of free
tenure is (as the booke saith)
where a man holdeth by free
seruice of 12. pence by yeare,
for all maner of seruices, or by
other seruices yearely. Soccage
of auncient tenure is of land
of auncient Demesn , where no
writ originall shall be siewed,
but the writ of Right, that is
called <term lang="la">secundum consuetudinem
manerii</term>. Soccage of base tenure
is of those that hould in Soc&#173;
cage, and may haue none other
writ, but the <term lang="la">Monstraverunt</term> :
and such Sockmen hould not by
certaine Seruice. And for that
are they not free Sockmen. Then
againe Soccage is diuided into
soccage in cheife, and common
soccage. Soccage in cheife or
in capite , is that which holdeth
of the King, as of his Crowne.
Pr&#230;rog. fol. 41. Common Soc&#173;
cage is that, which holdeth of

uers significations in our com&#173;
mon lawe. First, it signifieth a
Decree or act of Parlament ,
made by the Prince and three
estates, which is the bodie of
the whole Realme. And though
it borow the name from that
kind of Decree, which those
cities, that were vnder the Ro&#173;
maine Empire, made for the
particular gouernment of them&#173;
selues, ouer and aboue the vni&#173;
uersall or common lawe of the
Empire: yet in nature it com&#173;
meth nearest to that which
the Romaines called (<term lang="la">legem</term>)
for that, as that was made by
the whole people noble and
ignoble: so this is ordeined
by those, that represent the
whole number, both of prince,
and subiects, one and other,
through the whole kingdome.
The difference neuerthelesse was
this, that Lex was offered to the
consideration of the people by
the Magistrate of the Senate, or
Consull: but the bils or sug&#173;
gestions whence our statutes
spring, are offered by any of ei&#173;

I haue reade in an auncient
manuscript of what credit, I
know not, that this officer was
of so great power in auncient
times, that if any one had sought
iustice in the Kings Court and
not found it, he might vpon
complaint thereof made vnto
him, take those petitions, and re&#173;
seruing them to the next Parla&#173;
ment, cause them there to bee
propon<emend err="n">u</emend>ded, and not onely so,
but also in the presence of the
King openly to rebuke the
Chaunceler, or any other Iudge,
or officer whom he found defe&#173;
ctiue in yeelding iustice. And if
in case the Iudge, or officer so
reprehended, did alledge, that
his defect grew from the difficul&#173;
tie of the case, infomuch as
he durst not aduenture vpon it:
then the case being shewed, and
so found, the Lord steward to&#173;
gether with the Constable of
England there in the presence
of the King and Parlament,
might elect 25. persons, or
more, or fewer, according to
their discretion, and the case
or cases in question, some
Earles, some Barons, some
Knights, some Citizens and Bur&#173;
gesses, which vpon deliberation
should fet downe, what they
thought iust and equal: and their
decree being read and allowed
by Parlament, did stand as a law
for euer: fardermore, if the
Chaunceler or other Iudge or
officer, could not well approue,
that the delay of iustice com&#173;
plained of, grew from iust diffi&#173;
cultie, by reason that the case in
question was formerly determi&#173;

might the steward on the Kings
behalfe, admonish him of his
negligence and will him to be
more carefull and studious. Or
if there appeared malice, or cor&#173;
ruption, then the King and Par&#173;
lament was wont to remoue him
and assigne another of better
hope to the place. Lastly, if the
king had about him any such e&#173;

the King of their intention, to
send to that Counseler, and will

might send to the King, and will

suite custom, suite reall, and suite
seruice. Suite couenant , he defi&#173;
neth to be, when your auncester

come to the Shyreeues Turne,

are c<expan type="">om</expan>pelled to come, to knowe
the lawes, so that they may
not be ignorant of things de&#173;
clared there, how they ought to
be gouerned. And it is called
reall, because of their alle&#173;
gance. And this appeareth by
common exeperience, when
one is sworne: his oath is that
he shall be a loyall and faithfull
man to the King. And this
suite is not for the land that he
holdeth within the Countie
but by reason of his person and
his aboade there, and ought to
be done twice a yeare: for de&#173;
fault whereof he shallbe amer&#173;
ced and not distreined. I thinke
this should be called ra&#173;
ther regall or royall, because it
is performed to the King for
(royall). The French word in
the vsuall pronuntiation com&#173;
meth neere to reall, the leter (o)
being almost suppressed. see
Leete. Suyte seruice , is to siew to the

the Lords court from three
weekes to three weekes by the
whole yeare. And for default
thereof a man shall be distrei&#173;

And in that chapter shall you
finde the most of those tenures
recited, that be now vsually in

that there be foure maner of te&#173;

which houldeth of the King,
Church, Barons, or others, pay&#173;

payment of a peny, rose, paire
of guilt spurs, or some such like
thing, if it be asked, in name of
Blench, <term lang="la">id est nomine alb&#230; firm&#230;</term>.
The fourth is by seruice of ward,
and relieue, where the heire be&#173;

lands, &#38;c. And land houlden in

greate mischief to his church: &#38;
that by the law of God and

both thinke well of it. Where&#173;
fore those customes of paying
a halfepeny for a lambe, or a

haue vnder seuen in one yeare,
how long so euer it hath indu&#173;

by this course the minister fa&#173;

Custom or prescription to haue
Toll through in the high way,
is not good: for it is against
the common right. But to haue
prescription of Tolle Trauers, is
good. In which place the diffe&#173;

author seemeth to differ from
Kitchin touching the lawfulnes
of tolle through, saying that by
reason of a bridge prouided at
the cost and charge of the
towne, for the ease of trauellers,
he thinketh it resonable, that
tolle through be exacted toward
the maintenance thereof: which
writer also maketh mention of
tolle turn: and that he defineth
to be tolle paide for beastes dri<emend err=". ">&#173;</emend>

from thence drawne through the
middest of London to Tiburne ,
and there hanged: and liuing

French word signifiing as much
as <term lang="fr">Mors, obitus, excessus</term>. The rea&#173;
son whereof I take to be, because
in interpretation it is a passage
from one place or estate to
another: for in Britton, cap. 29. I
find trespassants for passengers. In
our common law and language,
it is vsed for any transgression
of the lawe, vnder treason, fe&#173;
lonie, or misprision of treason, or
of felonie, as may be gathered
out of Stawnf. pl. cor. fol. 38.
where he saith, that for a Lord
of the Parlament to depart from
the Parlament without the kings
licence, is neither treason ner fe&#173;
lonie, but trespasse. And againe,
fol. 31. saying, that where it was
wont before the statute made
<term lang="la">anno</term> prim. Ed. 2. called <term lang="la">Statutum
de frangentibus prisonam</term> , that the
breach of prison was felonie, if
it were the Kings prison: it is
sithence but trespasse, except the
prisoner were committed for
felonie. But it is most com&#173;
monly vsed for that wrong or
dammage, which is done by a
priuate man to the King, as in
his Forest, pl. cor. lib. 2. cap. 18.
or to another priuate man. And
in this signification it is of two
sortes: trespasse generall, other&#173;
wise termed, trespasse <term lang="la">vi &#38; ar&#173;
mis</term> : and trespasse especiall, other&#173;
wise called trespasse vpon the
case. And this seemeth to be
without force. Termes of the
Lawe. Action vpon the case, as
appeareth by Kitchin, fol. 176.
The former I take to be called
generall, because it riseth from
that generall ground in lawe,
that whatsoeuer is done by any
priuate mans humour <term lang="la">vi &#38; armis</term> ,
is an offence. The later I call e&#173;
speciall, because Kitchin calleth
the other generall: and another
reason may be this, because it
springeth from a particular case
or fact, not conteined vnder any
other generall head. And the a&#173;
ction lying for this trespasse, is
otherwise called an action vpon
the case, as may be gathered out
of diuers places vnder the title
Trespasse , in Brookes his Abridge&#173;
ment. How to distinguish the
forme of these writs or actions,
See Fitz. nat. br. fol. 86. I. &#38; 87.
H. I. In an action of trespasse,
this is perpetuall, that the plain&#173;
tiffe sieweth for dammages, or
the valew of the hurt done vn&#173;
to him by the Defendant. It
seemeth an hard thing to distin&#173;
guish these two kinds of tres&#173;
passes so, as to be able to say
when it is a trespasse <term lang="la">vi &#38; armis</term> ,
and when vpon the case: as may
well appeare to him that shall
peruse this title in Brooke. But
this is to be left to the experi<expan type="">en</expan>ce






</page>

<page sig="Vvv4r">
of graue and skilfull pleaders. I
find moreouer in Kitchin, fol. 188
that there is a trespasse locall , and
trespasse transitorie: trespasse locall
is that, which is so annexed to a
place certaine, as if the Defen&#173;
dant ioyne issue vpon the place,
and trauers the place, onely by
saying, <term lang="la">Absque hoc</term> , that he did
the trespasse in the place men&#173;
tioned in the declaration, and a&#173;
verre it, it is enough to defeate
the action. Trespasse transitorie is
that, which cannot be defeated
by the defendants trauers of the
place, saying: without that I c<expan type="">om</expan>&#173;
mitted the trespasse in the place
declared: because the place is
not materiall. Examples of both
you haue set downe by Kitchin ,
in the place aboue named, to this
effect: trauers by (<term lang="la">Absque hoc</term>) of
trespasse in batterie, or goods
brought in, is transitorie, and
not locall: as it is of trees cut, or
herbes.

And therefore in trespasse
transitorie the place shall not
make issue, neither is it trauersa&#173;
ble: no more then is a trespasse
vpon a case of an Assumption.

Mar. cap. 10. to this purpose.
And be it furder enacted by
the authoritie aforesaid, that all
trials hereafter to be had, awar&#173;

the due order and course of the
common lawes of this Realme,

word (triall) saith Stawnf. in that
place, some vnderstand as well
the inquest that indicteth a man,
as the enquest vpon the arraign&#173;
ment, that attainteth or acqui&#173;
teth him. For these two make
but one entire triall, that euery
man is to haue, when he is im&#173;
peached of treason. But others
haue answered to this, that triall
in common speech, is the triall
that a man is to haue, after he is
indicted, and not before. For in
lawe the inditement is nought,
but the accusation against him,
which he is to make answer vnto
and that being tried, it either
attainteth, or acquiteth him. So
that the triall is the issue, which
is tried vpon the Inditement, &#38;
not the Inditement it selfe. For
that is no part of the thing
which trieth, <emend err="hut">but</emend> the thing which

In causes criminall there be
two sorts of Enquests, one called
the graund Enquest, and the
other the Enquest of life and
death. The graund Enquest is so
called, either because it con&#173;
sisteth commonly of a greater
number then 12. as of 2 4.
1 8. or 16. at the least, or els
because all causes criminall or
penall first passe through them:
whereas the other Enquest is e&#173;
specially appointed for one or
few maters touching life and
death, committed to their consi&#173;
derations. Those of the grand
Enquest are also called by Bra&#173;
cton 12. milites lib. 3. tracta. 2.

so many knights could not be
found. <term lang="la">Idem eodem</term>. num. 1. in fine.
And their function is to receiue
all presentments made vnto
them of any offence, and ac&#173;
cordingly to giue their generall
opinion of the presentment by
writing either these words (<term lang="la">Billa

the party presented: or els this

minall causes be of two sortes,
either capitall touching life and

effect. Villenage is a tenure of
the demesns of a Lord deliuered
to a Tenent at the Lords will, by
villenous seruices, to improoue
it to the Lords vse, and deliue&#173;
red by the rodde, and not by a&#173;
ny title of writing, or succession
of inheritance, &#38;c. And a litle
after he hath words to this effect:
In the maners of our auncient
Demesns, there be pure villeins
both by blood and <emend err="renure">tenure</emend>: the
which may be cast out of their
tenement, and depriued of their
chatels, at the pleasure of the
Lord. By which two places I ga&#173;
ther, though villein tenure doe
not alway make the Tenent a
villein: yet that there is a twofold
tenure called villenage: one
wherin both the pers<expan type="">on</expan> &#38; the te&#173;
nure is bound, and in all respects
at the disposition of the Lord:
and another, which in resp ect of
the tenure is after a sort ser&#173;
uile, though the person be not
bond. This is well proued by
Bracton, li. 2. ca. 8. nu. 3. in these
words. Item tenementum non mu&#173;
tat statum liberi, non magis quam
serui: Poterit enim liber homo tene&#173;
re purum villenagium, faciendo
quicquid ad villanum pertinebit, &#38;
nihilo-minus liber erit, cum hoc fa&#173;
ciat ratione villenagii, &#38; non perso&#173;
n&#230; su&#230;: &#38; ideo poterit, quando volu&#173;
erit, villenagium deserere, &#38; liber
discedere, nisi illaqueatus sit per vxo&#173;
rem natiuam ad hoc faciendum ad
quam ingressus fuit in villenagium,
&#38; qu&#230; pr&#230;stare poterit impedimen&#173;
tum, &#38;c. So that a man may
hould in pure villenage, and yet
be a free man in respect of his
person. But what is pure ville&#173;
nage? Bracton aunswereth in the
words there next following: Pu&#173;
rum villenagium est, &#224; quo pr&#230;statur
seruitium in certum &#38; indetermina&#173;
tum, vbi sciri non poterit vespere,
quale seruitium fieri debet mane.
viz: vbi quis facere tenetur quic&#173;
quid ei pr&#230;ceptum fuerit. The o&#173;
ther sort of villenage which is
not pure, is there called of Bra&#173;
cton (villanum soccagium) which
differeth from the other in this,
because it is onely tyed to the
perform<emend err="r">a</emend>nce of certaine seruices
agreed vpon betweene the Lord
and the Tenent. Whereof see
Bracton also in the same place:
by whom you may perceiue,
that a man may hould (per villa&#173;
num soccagium) and yet haue (li&#173;
berum tenementum if he haue it
to himselfe and his heires. This
villanous soccage is to cary the

nameth some shires of this side

the words there folowing, there
is a reason giuen of this appella&#173;

W arrantie signifieth in our com&#173;

any thing agreed of betweene
them. And he that maketh this
warrantie, is called Warrantus
by Bracton, lib. 2. cap. 10. &#38; 37.
The Romaines called him Au&#173;

that which we terme vocationem

thoris laudationem vel nominatio&#173;

warranty passeth from the seller
to the buyer, from the feoffer
to the feoffee, from him that
releaseth, to him that is released
of an action reall, and such
like. And for the forme it passeth
in a clause toward the end of a
deed in these wordes: Et ego ver&#242;

a clause of warrantie. Idem,
eodem. titulo Releases. sect. 510.

There is also a warrant of At&#173;
turney, whereby a man appoin<emend err="">&#173;</emend>
teth another to do some thing
in his name, and warranteth his
action, West. eod. sect. 1 81. And
these warr<expan type="">an</expan>ts of Atturney seeme
to differ from leters of Attur&#173;
ney, because that, whereas leters
passe ordinarily vnder the hand
and seale of him, that maketh an
Atturney by them, before any
credible witnesses: warrants of
Atturney be acknowledged be&#173;
fore such persons, by such means
and in such maner, as Fines. West.

But these waranties in passing
land from one to another, be of
greatest consequent, &#38; of more
intricate vnderstanding. And
therefore of these, diuers haue
written at large: as Glanvile lib.

pounder of law terms saith, that
this warranty beginneth two
waies: one by deede of law: as
if one and his auncesters, haue
held land of another and his aun&#173;
cesters, time out of minde by ho&#173;
mage (which is called Homage
auncestrell) for in this case, the ho&#173;
mage c<expan type="">on</expan>tinually performed by
the tenent is sufficient to bind the
Lord to warrant his estate. The
other is by deede of the party,
which by deede or fine tyeth
himselfe to warrant the land or
tenement to the tenent. And Sir
Ed: Cooke in the fourth booke of
his reports, mentioneth the same
distinction. Nokes case, fo. 81. a.
calling the one a warranty in
law, the other an expresse war&#173;
ranty. Ciuilians would call these
species, tacitam &#38; expressam. </xpln></wordentry>

<wordentry type="h"><form lang="en" lexeme="warranty(n)">Warranty</form> <xpln lang="en">(as the said author
of the terms of law saith, is in
two maners: warranty lineall,
and warranty collaterall. But
(Litleton saith vbi supra) it is
threefold: warranty lineall, war&#173;
ranty collaterall, and warranty
that beginneth by disseisin. War&#173;
ranty by disseisin what it is, is
partly declared in Sir Ed. Cookes
reports, li. 3. Fermors case, fol. 78.
a. Whether of them deuideth
more aptly, let the learned iudge.
For my part, I thinke that line&#173;
all and collaterall be no essenti&#173;
all <emend err="disserences">differences</emend> of warranty, as it
is originally considered in the
first warranter. For he bindeth
himselfe and his heires in gene&#173;
rall. And such be bound, be they
lineall or collaterall vnto him.
Therefore this diuision riseth
rather from the euent of the ori&#173;
ginall warranty: videlicet , because
it so falleth out, that the tenent,
to whom the warranty was
made, or his heires, when he or
they be called into question for
the land warranted formerly by
the first feoffour, is driuen by the
meanes of the first warranters
death, to cal or vouch him to wa&#173;
ranty that is his heire, and now
presently liuing, be he descen&#173;
ding or collaterall, as it falleth
out. For example. A. infeoffeth
B. in twenty acres land, with
clause of warranty against all
men. So long as A. himselfe li&#173;
ueth, he is liable to this coue&#173;
nant, and none els: after his dis&#173;
cease his heire is subiect vnto it,
be he his sonne, brother, vncle,
or what els. And whether of
these, or neither of these it will
be, none knoweth vntill he be
dead. Wherefore I conclude
that this distinction of lineall or






</page>

<page sig="Aaaa4r">
collaterall hath no vse originally
in this contract. For (as the au&#173;
thor of the terms of law saith)
the burd<damage type="inking">en</damage> of this warranty, af&#173;
ter the death of the first warran&#173;
ter, falleth vpon him, vpon
whom the land should haue des&#173;
cended, if the warranty had not
bene made. And that is the next
of blood to the warranter, be
he in the descending or collate&#173;
rall line. And therefore I re&#173;
solue that this distinction grow&#173;
eth from an euent, after the death
of him that couenanteth to war&#173;
rant. But to make this plaine, I
finde warranty to be vsed equi&#173;
uocally: signifiing in one sort,
the contract, or couenant of war&#173;
ranty first made, as appeareth by
Bracton in the place formerly
noted: and in another fort the
very effect and performance of
this contract, either by the war&#173;
ranter or his heires, when he or
they be by the tenent thereunto
vouched, or called: As also I
shew out of Bracton, lib. 5. tract.
4. ca. pri. nu. 2. in these words.
Imprimis videndum est quid sit war&#173;
rantizatio. Et sciendum quod war&#173;
rantizare, nihil aliud est, qu&#224;m de&#173;
fendere &#38; acquietare tenentem, qui
warrantum vocabit in seisina sua,
&#38;c. With whom agreeth Fleta
saying that warrantizare nihil ali&#173;
ud est, quam possidentem defendere,
li. 5. ca. 15. &#167; 1. &#38; lib. 6. ca 23
quod lege per totum. And the for&#173;
mer diuision of lineall and colla&#173;
terall warranty, rather belongeth
to warranty in this second signi&#173;
fication then the former.

And that this way it is im&#173;
perfect or at the least obscure,
I thinke it not hard to declare.
First to shew this I note out
of Bracton , who may be called
to warrantie. And he lib. 5. tra&#173;
ctat. 4. cap. pri. num. 5. saith thus:
Videndum est quis vocari possit ad

that the burden of this warran&#173;
tie is not tyed to heires on&#173;

sed all such, as the first warran&#173;

And in these two later cases,
warranty in the sec<expan type="">on</expan>d significa&#173;

L itleton , and the other author
haue defined, or by examples
expressed them.

But yet let vs define these two
species, as they be. wherefore li&#173;
neall warranty is that, which
he is called vnto by the tenent,
vpon whome the land warran&#173;

B. 20. acres land with clause of
warranty, and afterward dieth
leauing issue. C. soone after B.

D. and voucheth. C. This is

<wordentry type="h"><form lang="en" lexeme="warranty collateral(n)">Warranty collaterall ,</form> <xpln lang="en">is that
wherevnto he is called by the
tenent vpon the couenant of
him, from whome the land
could not descend to the party
called. For example; B. the
sonne pourchaseth tenements
in fee, whereof A. his father
disseiseth him, and selleth them
to C. with a clause of war&#173;
ranty. A being deade, C. is
impleaded for the tenements,
and calleth B. to warranty. This
warranty wherevnto B. is caled,
is collaterall: bycause the tene&#173;
ments, if the warrnty had not
beene couenanted by A. could
not haue descended from him
to his father A. for they were
his owne by Pourchase. Many
other ex<expan type="">am</expan>ples there be of this in
Litleton. And this very case he
maketh his example of war&#173;
ranty by disseisin, as also of
warranty collaterall. which

prescription or graunte from the
king to a man of hauing fesants,
partridges, connies, and hares,
within certaine of his lands,
Cromptons Iurisdict. fol. 1 4 8. where
he saith, that none can haue war&#173;
ren, but onely the King, no more
then Forest or chase. Because it
is a speciall priuiledge belon&#173;
ging to the King alone. And a
little after he hath words to
this effect: The king may graunt
warren to me in mine owne
lands, for fesants and partridges
onely. And by this graunt no
man may there chase them
without my licence. And so of
Hares, but not of Connies. For
their property is to destroy the
fruites of the earth, as to eate
corne, and pille the barke of ap&#173;
ple trees. M. Manwood in his first
part of Forest lawes, saith thus of
it : A warren is a fraunchise or
priuiledged place of pleasure,
onely for those beasts and foules
that are beasts and foules of
warren, tant&#249;m campestres &#38; non
syluestres. viz. For such beasts
and foules as are altogether
belonging to the feilds, and not
vnto the woods: and for none o&#173;
ther beasts or foules. There are
but two beasts of warren, that
is to say Hares and Connies: and
there are also but two foules of
warren, viz. Fesants and partrid&#173;
ges And none other wild beasts
or birds haue any firme peace,
priuiledge, or protection, within
the warren. If any person be
found to be an offender in any
such free warren, he is to be
punished for the same by the
course of the common law, and
by the statute. a<emend err="u">n</emend>no 21. Ed. 3.

For the most parte there are noe

master of the game, or the kee&#173;
per. A sree warren is some time
inclosed, and also the same
some time doth lie open. for

therevpon in many bookes of

goods, so brought to land are
called wreck. And wreck is defi&#173;
ned to be those goods which
are so brought to land. Sir Ed.
Coke vol. 6. relatio, f. 106. a. &#38; the
statute anno 17. Ed. 2. ca. 1 1. in
these words. Item Rex habebit
wreccum maris, per totum Regnum,
ballenas, &#38; sturgiones captas in
mari vel alibi infra Regnum, ex&#173;
ceptis quibusdam locis privilegiatis
per Regem. Whereby it appea&#173;
reth that the King hath them,
or such as haue by graunt this

And that this statute doth but
affirme the auncient lawe of

cton, lib. 2. cap. 5. num. 7. hiis ver&#173;

quia non apparet Dominus eorum,
sed iure Gentium fieri principis:
And see him also, lib. 2. cap. 24.
num. 1. &#38; 2. It is worth the
asking to know twhat is a wreck,
and what not in this stricter sig&#173;
nification. And the author of the
termes of lawe saith, that if
any person of the shippe
come to land, it is not
a wreck, or the wreck is not
such, that the king ought to
haue the goods. with whome
agreeth S. Ed. Coke. vol. 6. f. 107. a.
No, if either Dogge or Catte
escape aliue to the land: the
goods are the owners still, so
he come within a yeare, and day
to claime them. And for this
the statute is plaine Westm. pri. ca.
4. anno 3. Edw. pri. which do&#173;
ctrine Fitzh. in his nat. br. fol.
11 2. E. extendeth thus farre,
that if any of the goods be cast
vpon the drie land by any in
the shippe, it is no wreck subiect
to the prerogatiue, for by this
some of the shippe are presumed
to come to land, and still to
haue a custodie of the goods.

As in a case of an estray, if the

<wordentry type="h"><form lang="en" lexeme="yeoman(n)">Yoman ,</form> <xpln lang="en">seemeth to be one
word made by contraction of
two Danish words (yong men)
which I gather out of Canutus
Charter of the Forest set out by
M. Manwood parte prins. fol. prim.
num. 2. in these words: Sunt sub
quolibet horum quatuor ex medio&#173;
cribus hominibus, quos Angli (Le&#173;
gespend) nuncupant, Dani ver&#242;
(yong men) vocant, locati, qui curam
&#38; onus tum viridis tum veneris
suscipiant. These M. Camden in
his Britan. pag. 105. placeth next
in order to Gentlemen, calling
them (Ingenuos) whose opinion
the statute affirmeth, anno 16.
R. 2. cap. 4. whereunto adde
the statute anno 20. eiusdem Re&#173;
gis cap. 2. Sir Thomas Smith in his
Repub. Anglor. lib. prim. cap. 23.
calleth him a Yoman, whom our
lawes call legalem hominem :
which (as he saith) is in English
a Free man borne, that may
dispend of his owne free land, in
yerely reuenew, to the summe
of forty shillings sterling. Of
these he writeth a good large dis&#173;
course, touching their estate and
vse in this common wealth. The
former etymologie of the name
he liketh not, making question
whether it come of the Dutch
(yonker) yea or not, which in
the Low countries signifieth a
meane Gentleman, or a gay
fellow. But he that hath added
the marginall notes to that
booke, seemeth to draw it from
the Saxon (Geman) which signi&#173;
fieth a maried man. M. Verstegan
in his restitution of decayed in&#173;
telligence, cap. 10. writeth, that
(Gemen) among the auncient
Teutonicks , and (Gemein) among
the moderne, signifieth as much,
as Common, and that the first
leter G. is in this word, as in ma&#173;
ny others, turned into Y. and so
written Yemen , and that therfore
Yemen, or Yeoman signifieth so
much as Commoner. Yoman
signifieth an Officer in the Kings
house, which is in the middle
place betweene the Sergeant
and the Groome: as Yoman of
the Chaundrie, and Yoman of
the Scullerie. anno 33. H. 8. cap.
12. Yoman of the Crowne. anno
3. Ed. 4. cap. 5. &#38; anno 2 2. eius.
