    Goe little booke: thy selfe present,
As child whose parent is vnkent:
To him that is the president
Of noblesse and of cheualree,
And if that Enuie barke at thee,
As sure it will, for succoure flee
    Vnder the shadow of his wing,
And asked, who thee forth did bring,
A shepheards swaine saye did thee sing,
All as his straying flocke he fedde:
And when his honor has thee redde,
Craue pardon for my hardyhedde.
    But if that any aske thy name,
Say thou wert base begot with blame:
For thy thereof thou takest shame.
And when thou art past ieopardee,
Come tell me, what was sayd of mee:
And I will send more after thee.

<section type="Introduction">
The generall argument of 
the whole booke.

LIttle I hope, needeth me at large to discourse the first Originall of &#198;glo&#173;
gues, hauing alreadie touched the same. But for the word &#198;glogues I 
know is vnknowen to most, and also mistaken of some the best learned 
(as they think) I wyll say somewhat thereof, being not at all impertin<expan type="">en</expan>t
to my present purpose.

They were first of the Greekes the inuentours of them called &#198;glo&#173;
gaj as it were <term lang="gr">&#x1F70;&#x1F30;&#x03B3;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</term> or <term lang="gr">&#x03B9;&#x1F70;&#x03B3;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x03BC;&#x03C9;&#x03BD;. &#x03BB;&#x03CC;&#x03B3;&#x03B9;</term>. that is Goteheards tales. For although in Virgile 
and others the speakers be most shepheards, and Goteheards, yet Theocritus in whom is 
more ground of authoritie, then in Virgile, this specially from that deriuing, as from the 
first head and welspring the whole Inuencion of his &#198;glogues, maketh Goteheards the 
persons and authors of his tales. This being, who seeth not the grossenesse of such as by 
colour of learning would make vs beleeue that they are more rightly termed Eclogai, as 
they would say, extraordinary discourses of vnnecessarie matter, which difinition albe in 
substaunce and meaning it agree with the nature of the thing, yet nowhit answereth with 
the <term lang="gk">&#x1F70;&#x03BD;&#x03AC;&#x03BB;&#x03C5;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;</term> and interpretation of the word. For they be not termed Eclogues, but &#198;g&#173;
logues. which sentence this authour very well obseruing, vpon good iudgement, though 
indeede few Goteheards haue to doe herein, nethelesse doubteth not to cal th<expan type="">em</expan> by the 
vsed and best knowen name. Other curious discourses hereof I reserue to greater occa<emend err="">&#173;</emend>
sion. These xij. &#198;clogues euery where answering to the seasons of the twelue monthes 
may be well deuided into three formes or ranckes. For eyther they be Plaintiue, as the 
first, the sixt, the eleuenth, &#38; the twelfth, or recreatiue, such as al those be, which conceiue 
matter of loue, or commendation of special personages, or Moral: which for the most 
part be mixed with some Satyrical bitternesse, namely the second of reuerence dewe to 
old age, the  fift of coloured deceipt, the seuenth and ninth of dissolute shepheards &#38; pas&#173;
tours, the tenth of contempt of Poetrie &#38; pleasaunt wits. And to this diuision may eue&#173;
ry thing herein be reasonably applyed: A few onely except, whose speciall purpose and 
meaning I am not priuie to. And thus much generally of these xij. &#198;clogues. Now will 
we speake particularly of all, and first of the first. which he calleth by the first monethes 
name Ianuarie: wherein to some he may seeme fowly to haue faulted, in that he erroni&#173;
ously beginneth with that moneth, which beginneth not the yeare. For it is wel known 
and stoutely mainteyned with stronge reasons of the learned, that the yeare beginneth 
in March. for then the sonne reneweth his finished course, and the seasonable spring refre<emend err="">&#173;</emend>
sheth the earth, and the pleasaunce thereof being buried i<emend err="u">n</emend> the sadnesse of the dead winter 
now worne away, reliueth. This opinion maynteine the olde Astrologers and Philoso&#173;
phers, namely the reuerend Andalo, and Macrobius in his holydayes of Saturne, which 
accoumpt also was generally obserued both of Grecians and Romans. But sauing the 
leaue of such learned heads, we mayntaine a custome of coumpting the seasons from the 
moneth Ianuary, vpon a more speciall cause, then the heathen Philosophers euer coulde 
conceiue, that is, for the incarnation of our mighty Sauiour and eternall redeemer the L. 
Christ, who as then renewing the state of the decayed world, and returning the c<expan type="">om</expan>passe 
of expired yeres to theyr former date and first commencement, left to vs his heires a me&#173;
moriall of his birth in the ende of the last yeere and beginning of the next. which recko<emend err="">&#173;</emend>
ning, beside that eternall monument of our saluation, leaneth also vppon good proofe of






</page>

<page sig="">
special iudgem<expan type="">en</expan>t. For albeit that in elder times, when as yet the coumpt of the yere was 
not perfected, as afterwarde it was by Iulius C&#230;sar, they began to tel the monethes from 
Marches begi<emend err="a">n</emend>ning, and according to the same God (as is sayd in Scripture) comaunded 
the people of the Iewes to count the moneth Abil, that which we call March, for the 
first moneth, in remembraunce that in that moneth he brought them out of the land of 
&#198;gipt: yet according to tradition of latter times it hath bene otherwise obserued, both 
in gouernment of <emend err="of"></emend> the church, and rule of Mightiest Realmes. For from Iulius C&#230;sar 
who first obserued the leape yeere which he called Bissextilem Annum, and brought in 
to a more certain course the odde wandring dayes which of the Greekes were called 
<term lang="gk">&#x1F7A;&#x03C0;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x03B2;&#x03B1;&#x03AF;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03C2;</term>. of the Romanes intercalares (for in such matter of learning I am forced to 
vse the termes of the learned) the monethes haue bene nombred xij. which in the first 
ordinaunce of Romulus were but tenne, counting but CCCiiij. dayes in euery yeare, 
and beginning with March. But Numa Pompilius, who was the father of al the Romain 
ceremonies and religion, seeing that reckoning to agree neither with the course of the 
sonne, nor of the Moone, therevnto added two monethes, Ianuary and February: wher&#173;
in it seemeth, that wise king minded vpon good reason to begin the yeare at Ianuarie, of 
him therefore so called tanquam Ianua anni the gate and entraunce of the yere, or of the 
name of the god Ianus, to which god for that the old Paynims attributed the byrth &#38; 
beginning of all creatures new comming into the worlde, it seemeth that he therfore 
to him assigned the beginning and first enrraunce of the yeare. which account for the 
most part hath hetherto continued. Notwithstanding that the &#198;giptians beginne theyr 
yeare at September, for that according to the opinion of the best Rabbins, and very pur&#173;
pose of the scripture selfe, God made the worlde in that Moneth, that is called of them 
Tisri And therefore he commaunded them, to keepe the feast of Pauilions in the end of 
the yeare, in the xv. day of the seuenth moneth, which before that time was the first.

But our Authour respecting nether the subtiltie of thone parte, nor the antiquitie of 
thother, thinketh it fittest according to the simplicitie of commen vnderstanding, to be&#173;
gin with Ianuarie, wening it perhaps no decor<emend err="u"><expan type="">um</expan></emend>, that Sepheard should be seene in mat<emend err="">&#173;</emend>
ter of so deepe insight, or canuase a case of so doubtful iudgment. So therefore beginneth
he &#38; so continueth he throughout.

<section type="Dedication">
&#182; To the most excellent and learned both 
Orator and Poete, Mayster Gabriell Haruey, his 
verie special and singular good frend E. K. commen&#173;
deth the good lyking of this his labour, 
and the patronage of the 
new Poete.

VNCOVTHE VNKISTE, Sayde the olde famous Poete 
Chaucer: whom for his excellencie and wonderfull skil in making, 
his scholler Lidgate, a worthy scholler of so excellent a maister, cal&#173;
leth the Loadestarre of our Language: and whom our Colin clout in 
his &#198;glogue calleth Tityrus the God of shepheards, comparing hym 
to the worthines of the Roman Tityrus Virgile. Which prouerbe, 
myne owne good friend Ma. Haruey, as in that good old Poete it ser&#173;
ued well Pandares purpose, for the bolstering of his baudy brocage, so very well taketh 
place in this our new Poete, who for that he is vncouthe (as said Chaucer) is vnkist, and 
vnknown to most m<expan type="">en</expan>, is regarded but of few. But I dout not, so soone as his name shall 
come into the knowledg of men, and his worthines be sounded in the tromp of fame,
but that he shall be not onely kiste, but also beloued of all, embraced of the most, and 
wondred at of the best. No lesse I thinke, deserueth his wittinesse in deuising, his pithi&#173;
nesse in vttering, his complaints of loue so louely, his discourses of pleasure so pleasantly, 
his pastorall rudenesse, his morall wisenesse, his dewe obseruing of Decorum euerye 
where, in personages, in seasons, in matter, in speach, and generally in al seemely simply&#173;
citie of handeling his matter, and framing his words: the which of many thinges which 
in him be straunge, I know will seeme the straungest, the words them selues being so 
auncient, the knitting of them so short and intricate, and the whole Periode &#38; compasse 
of speache so delightsome for the roundnesse, and so graue for the straungenesse. And 
firste of the wordes to speake, I graunt they be something hard, and of most men vnused, 
yet both English, and also vsed of most excellent Authors and most famous Poetes. In 
whom whenas this our Poet hath bene much traueiled and throughly redd, how could 
it be, (as that worthy Oratour sayde) but that walking in the sonne although for other 
cause he walked, yet needes he mought be sunburnt; and hauing the sound of those aun&#173;
cient Poetes still ringing in his eares, he mought needes in singing hit out some of theyr 
tunes. But whether he vseth them by such casualtye and custome, or of set purpose and 
choyse, as thinking them fittest for such rusticall rudenesse of shepheards, eyther for that 
theyr rough sounde would make his rymes more ragged and rustical, or els because such 
olde and obsolete wordes are most vsed of country folke, sure I think, and think I think 
not amisse, that they bring great grace, and, as one would say, auctoritie to the verse. For 
albe amongst many other faultes it specially be obiected of Valla against Liuie, and of o&#173;
ther against Saluste, that with ouer much studie they affect antiquitie, as coueting there&#173;
by credence and honor of elder yeeres, yet I am of opinion, and eke the best learned are 
of the lyke, that those auncient solemne wordes are a great ornament both in the one &#38; 
in the other; the one labouring to set forth in hys worke an eternall image of antiquitie, 
and the other carefully discoursing matters of grauitie and importaunce. For if my memo<emend err="">&#173;</emend>
ry fayle not, Tullie in that booke, wherein he endeuoureth to set forth the paterne of a






</page>

<page sig="">
perfect Oratour, sayth that ofttimes an auncient worde maketh the style seeme graue, 
and as it were reuerend: no otherwise then we honour and reuerence gray heares for a 
certein religious regard, which we haue of old age. yet nether euery where must old words 
be stuffed in, nor the commen Dialecte and maner of speaking so corrupted therby, that 
as in old buildings it seme disorderly &#38; ruinous. But all as in most exquisite pictures they 
vse to blaze and portraict not onely the daintie lineaments of beautye, but also rounde 
about it to shadow the rude thickets and craggy clifts, that by the basenesse of such parts, 
more excellency may accrew to the principall; for oftimes we fynde ourselues, I knowe 
not how, singularly delighted with the shewe of such naturall rudenesse, and take great 
pleasure in that disorderly order. Euen so doe those rough and harsh termes enlumine and 
make more clearly to appeare the brightnesse of braue &#38; glorious words. So ofentimes 
a dischorde in Musick maketh a comely concordaunce: so great delight tooke the worthy 
Poete Alceus to behold a blemish in the ioynt of a wel shaped body. But if any will rash&#173;
ly blame such his purpose in choyse of old and vnwonted words, him may I more iustly 
blame and condemne, or of witlesse headinesse in iudging, or of heedelesse hardinesse in 
condemning for not marking the compasse of hys bent, he wil iudge of the length of his 
cast for in my opinion it is one special prayse, of many whych are dew to this Poete, that 
he hath laboured to restore, as to theyr rightfull heritage such good and naturall English 
words, as haue ben long time out of vse &#38; almost cleare disherited. Which is the onely 
cause, that our Mother tonge, which truely of it self is both ful enough for prose &#38; stately 
enough for verse, hath long time ben co<expan type="">un</expan>ted most bare &#38; barrein of both. which default 
when as some endeuoured to salue &#38; recure, they patched vp the holes with peces &#38; rags 
of other languages, borrowing here of the french, there of the Italian, euery where of the 
Latine, not weighing how il, those tongues accorde with themselues, but much worse 
with ours: So now they haue made our English tongue, a gallimaufray or hodgepodge of 
al other speches. Other some no so wel seme in the English tonge as perhaps in other lan<emend err="">&#173;</emend>
guages, if th<expan type="">em</expan> happen to here an olde word albeit very naturall and significant, crye out 
streight way, that we speak no English, but gibbrish, or rather such, as in old time Eu<expan type="">an</expan>ders 
mother spake. whose first shame is, that they are not ashamed, in their own mother tonge 
straungers to be counted and alienes. The second shame no lesse then the first, that what 
so they vnderstand not, they streight way deeme to be sencelesse, and not at al to be vn&#173;
derstode. Much like to the Mole in &#198;sopes fable, that being blynd her selfe, would inno<emend err="">&#173;</emend>
wise be perswaded, that any beast could see. The last more shameful then both, that of 
their owne country and natural speach, which together with their Nources milk they 
sucked, they haue so base regard and bastard iudgement, that they will not onely them&#173;
selues not labor to garnish &#38; beautifie it, but also repine, that of other it shold be embel<emend err="">&#173;</emend>
lished. Like to the dogge in the maunger, that him selfe can eate no hay, and yet barketh 
at the hungry bullock, that so faine would feede: whose currish kind though cannot be 
kept from barking, yet I conne them thanke that they refrain from byting.

Now for the knitting of sentences, whych they call the ioynts and members therof, 
and for al the compasse of the speach, it is round without roughnesse, and learned wyth&#173;
out hardnes, such indeede as may be perceiued of the leaste, vnderstoode of the moste, 
but iudged onely of the learned. For what in most English wryters vseth to be loose, and 
as it were vngyrt, in this Authour is well grounded, finely framed, and strongly trussed vp 
together. In regard wherof, I scorne and spue out the rakehellye route of our ragged 
rymers (for so th<expan type="">em</expan>selues vse to hunt the letter) which without learning boste, without






</page>

<page sig="">
iudgement iangle, without reason rage and some, as if some instinct of Poeticall spirite 
had newly rauished them aboue the meannesse of commen capacitie. And being in the 
middest of all theyr brauery, sodenly eyther for want of matter, or of ryme, or hauing for<emend err="">&#173;</emend>
gotten theyr former conceipt, they seeme to be so pained and traueiled in theyr remem&#173;
brance, as it were a woman in childebirth or as that same Pythia, when the traunce came 
vpon her.

<term lang="la">Os rabidum fera corda domans &#38;c.</term>

Nethelesse let them a Gods name feede on theyr owne folly, so they seeke not to dar&#173;
ken the beames of others glory. As for Colin, vnder whose person the Authour selfe is 
shadowed, how furre he is from such vaunted titles and glorious showes, both him selfe 
sheweth, where he sayth.

<lemeformat>
Of Muses Hobbin. I conne no skill.              And
Enough is me to paint out my vnrest, &#38;c.
</lemeformat>
And also appeareth by the basenesse of the name, wherein, it semeth, he chose rather to 
vnfold great matter of argum<expan type="">en</expan>t couertly, then professing it, not suffice thereto according<emend err="">&#173;</emend>
ly. which moued him rather in &#198;glogues, then other wise to write, doubting perhaps 
his habilitie, which he little needed, or mynding to furnish our tongue with this kinde, 
wherein it faulteth, or following the example of the best &#38; most auncient Poetes, which 
deuised this kind of wryting, being both so base for the matter, and homely for the man&#173;
ner, at the first to trye theyr habilities? and as young birdes, that be newly crept out of 
the nest, by little first to proue theyr tender wyngs, before they make a greater flyght. So 
flew Theocritus, as you may perceiue he was all ready full fledged. So flew Virgile, as not 
yet well feeling his winges So flew Mantuane, as being not full somd. So Petrarque. So 
Boccace; So Marot, Sanazarus, and also diuers other excellent both Italian and French 
Poetes, whose foting this Author euery where followeth; yet so as few, but they be wel 
sented can trace him out. So finally flyeth this our new Poete, as a bird, whose principals 
be <expan type="">scarce growen</expan> out, but yet as that in time shall be hable to keepe wing with the best.

Now as touching the generall dryft and purpose of his &#198;glogues, I mind not to say 
much, him selfe labouring to conceale it. Onely this appeareth, that his vnstayed yougth 
had long wandred in the common Labyrinth of Loue, in which time to mitigate and 
allay the heate of his passion, or els to warne (as he sayth) the young shepheards .s. his e&#173;
qualls and companions of his vnfortunate folly, he compiled these xij. &#198;glogues, which 
for that they be proportioned to the state of the xij. monethes, he termeth the SHEP&#173;
HEARDS CALENDAR, applying an olde name to a new worke. Hereunto 
haue I added a certain Glosse or scholion for thexposition of old wordes &#38; harder phra&#173;
ses: which maner of glosing and commenting, well I wote, wil seeme straunge &#38; rare 
in our tongue: yet for somuch as I knew many excellent &#38; proper deuises both in wordes 
and matter would passe in the speedy course of reading, either as vnknowen, or as not 
marked, and that in this kind, as in other we might be equal to the learned of other nati&#173;
ons, I thought good to take the paines vpon me, the rather for that by meanes of some fa<emend err="">&#173;</emend>
miliar acquaintaunce I was made priuie to his counsell and secret meaning in them, as 
also in sundry other works of his. which albeit I know he nothing so much hateth, as to 
promulgate, yet thus much haue I aduentured vpon his frendship, him selfe being for 
long time furre estraunged, hoping that this will the rather occasion him, to put forth 
diuers other excellent works of his, which slepe in silence, as his Dreames, his Legendes, 
his Court of Cupide, and sondry others; whose commendations to set out, were verye

NOw I trust M. Haruey, that vpon sight of your speciall frends and fellow Poets 
doings, or els for enuie of so many vnworthy Quidams, which catch at the gar&#173;

darknesse, those so many excellent English poemes of yours, which lye hid, and bring th<expan type="">em</expan>

the desired sonne, and also your selfe, in smoothering your deserued prayses, and all men 
generally, in withholding from them so diuine pleasures, which they might conceiue of 
your gallant English verses, as they haue already doen of your Latine Poemes, which in 
my opinion both for inuention and Elocution are very delicate, and superexcellent. And 
thus againe, I take my leaue of my good Mayster Haruey. from my lodging at London

ARGVMENT.

IN this fyrst &#198;glogue Colin cloute a shepheardes boy complaineth him 
of his vnfortunate loue, being but newly (as semeth) enamoured of a coun&#173;
trie lasse called Rosalinde: with which strong affection being very sore tra&#173;
ueled, he compareth his carefull case to the sadde season of the yeare, to the 
frostie ground, to the frosen trees, and to his owne winterbeaten flocke. And 
lastlye, fynding himselfe robbed of all former pleasaunce and delights, hee 
breaketh his Pipe in peeces, and casteth him selfe to the ground.

COLIN Cloute.

A Shepeheards boye (no better doe him call)
when Winters wastful spight was almost spent,
All in a sunneshine day, as did befall,
Led forth his flock, that had bene long ypent.
So faynt they woxe, and feeble in the folde,
That now vnnethes their feete could them vphold.

All as the Sheepe, such was the shepeheards looke,
For pale and wanne he was, (alas the while,)
May seeme he loud, or els some care he tooke:
Well couth he tune his pipe, and frame his stile.






</page>

<page sig="a1v">
Tho to a hill his faynting flocke he ledde,
And thus him playnd, the while his shepe there fedde.

Ye Gods of loue, that pitie louers payne,
(If any gods the paine of louers pitie:)
Looke from aboue, where you in ioyes remaine,
And bowe your eares vnto my dolefull dittie.
And Pan thou shepheards God, that once didst loue,
Pitie the paines, that thou thy selfe didst proue.

Thou barrein ground, whome winters wrath hath wasted,
Art made a myrrhour, to behold my plight:
Whilome thy fresh spring flowrd, and after hasted
Thy sommer prowde with Daffadillies dight.
And now is come thy wynters stormy state,
Thy mantle mard, wherein thou mas-kedst late.

Such rage as winters, reigneth in my heart,
My life bloud friesing with vnkindly cold:
Such stormy stoures do breede my balefull smart,
As if my yeare were wast, and woxen old.
And yet alas, but now my spring begonne,
And yet alas, yt is already donne.

You naked trees, whose shady leaues are lost,
Wherein the byrds were wont to build their bowre:
And now are clothd with mosse and hoary frost,
Instede of bloosmes, wherwith your buds did flowre:
I see your teares, that from your boughes doe raine,
Whose drops in drery ysicles remaine.

All so my lustfull leafe is drye and sere,
My timely buds with wayling all are wasted:
The blossome, which my braunch of youth did beare,
With breathed sighes is blowne away, &#38; blasted,
And from mine eyes the drizling teares descend,
As on your boughes the ysicles depend.

Thou feeble flocke, whose fleece is rough and rent,
Whose knees are weake through fast and euill fare:

Mayst witnesse well by thy ill gouernement,
Thy maysters mind is ouercome with care.
Thou weake, I wanne: thou leane, I quite forlorne:
With mourning pyne I, you with pyning mourne.

A thousand sithes I curse that carefull hower.
Wherein I longd the neighbour towne to see:
And eke tenne thousand sithes I blesse the stoure,
Wherein I sawe so fayre a sight, as shee.
Yet all for naught: such sight hath bred my bane.
Ah God, that loue should breede both ioy and payne.

It is not Hobbinol, wherefore I plaine,
Albee my loue he seeke with dayly suit:
His clownish gifts and curtsies I disdaine,
His kiddes, his cracknelles, and his early fruit.
Ah foolish Hobbinol, thy gyfts bene vayne:
Colin them giues to Rosalind againe.

I loue thilke lasse, (alas why doe I loue?)
And am forlorne, (alas why am I lorne?)
Shee deignes not my good will, but doth reproue,
And of my rurall musick holdeth scorne.
Shepheards deuise she hateth as the snake,
And laughes the songes, that Colin Clout doth make.

Wherefore my pype, albee rude Pan thou please,
Yet for thou pleasest not, where most I would:
And thou vnlucky Muse, that wontst to ease
My musing mynd, yet canst not, when thou should:
Both pype and Muse, shall sore the while abye.
So broke his oaten pype, and downe dyd lye.

By that, the welked Ph&#339;bus gan availe,
His weary waine, and nowe the frosty Night
Her mantle black through heauen gan ouerhaile.
Which seene, the pensife boy halfe in despight
Arose, and homeward droue his sonned sheepe,
Whose hanging heads did seeme his carefull case to weepe.

ARGVMENT.

THis &#198;glogue is rather morall and generall, then bent to any secrete or 
particular purpose. It specially conteyueth a discourse of old age, in the 
persone of Thenot an olde Shepheard, who for his crookednesse and vnlusti&#173;
nesse, is scorned of Cuddie an vnhappy Heardmans boye. The matter ve&#173;
ry well accordeth with the season of the moneth, the yeare now drouping, &#38; 
as it were, drawing to his last age. For as in this time of yeare, so th<expan type="">en</expan> in our

bodies there is a dry &#38; withering cold, which congealeth the crudled blood, 
and frieseth the wetherbeat<expan type="">en</expan> flesh, with stormes of Fortune, &#38; hoare frosts 
of Care. To which purpose the olde man telleth a tale of the Oake and the 
Bryer, so liuely and so feelingly, as if the thing were set forth in some Pic&#173;
ture before our eyes, more plainly could not appeare.

CVDDIE.      THENOT.

AH for pittie, wil rancke Winters rage,
These bitter blasts neuer ginne tasswage?
The kene cold blowes through my beaten hyde,
All as I were through the body gryde.
My ragged rontes all shiver and shake,
As doen high Towers in an earthquake:
They wont in the wind wagge their wrigle tailes,
Perke as Peacock: but nowe it auales.

THENOT.

Lewdly complainest thou laesie ladde,
Of Winters wracke, for making thee sadde.
Must not the world wend in his commun course
From good to badd, and from badde to worse,
From worse vnto that is worst of all,
And then returne to his former fall?
Who will not suffer the stormy time,
Where will he liue tyll the lusty prime?
Selfe haue I worne out thrise threttie yeares,
Some in much ioy, many in many teares:
Yet neuer complained of cold nor heate,
Of Sommers flame, nor of Winters threat:
Ne euer was to Fortune foeman,
But gently tooke, that vngently came.
And euer my flocke was my chiefe care,
Winter or Sommer they mought well fare.

CVDDIE.

No marueile Thenot, if thou can beare
Cherefully the Winters wrathfull cheare:
For Age and Winter accord full nie,
This chill, that cold, this crooked, that wrye.
And as the lowring Wether lookes downe,






</page>

<page sig="a4r">
So semest thou like good fryday to frowne.
But my flowring youth is foe to frost,
My shippe vnwont in stormes to be tost.

THENOT.

The soueraigne of seas he blames in vaine,
That once seabeate, will to sea againe.
So loytring liue you little heardgroomes,
Keeping your beastes in the budded broomes:
And when the shining sunne langheth once,
You deemen, the Spring is come attonce.
Tho gynne you, fond flyes, the cold to scorne,
And crowing in pypes made of greene corne,
You thinken to be Lords of the yeare.
But eft, when ye count you freed from feare,
Comes the breme winter with chamfred browes,
Full of wrinckles and frostie furrowes:
Drerily shooting his stormy darte,
Which cruddles the blood, and pricks the harte.
Then is your carelesse corage accoied,
Your carefull heards with cold bene annoied.
Then paye you the price of your surquedrie,
With weeping, and wayling, and misery.

CVDDIE.
Ah foolish old man, I scorne thy skill,

That wouldest me, my springing youngth to spil.
I deeme, thy braine emperished bee
Through rusty elde, that hath rotted thee:
Or sicker thy head veray tottie is,
So on thy corbe shoulder it leanes amisse.
Now thy selfe hast lost both lopp and topp,
Als my budding braunch thou wouldest cropp:
But were thy yeares greene, as now bene myne,
To other delights they would encline.
Tho wouldest thou learne to caroll of Loue,
And hery with hymnes thy lasses gloue.
Tho wouldest thou pype of Phyllis prayse:
But Phyllis is myne for many dayes:






</page>

<page sig="a4v">
I wonne her with a gyrdle of gelt,
Embost with buegle about the belt.
Such an one shepeheards woulde make full faine:
Such an one would make thee younge againe.

THENOT.

Thou art a fon, of thy loue to boste,
All that is lent to loue, wyll be lost.

CVDDIE.

Seest, howe brag yond Bullocke beares,
So smirke, so smoothe, his pricked eares?
His hornes bene as broade, as Rainebowe bent,
His dewelap as lythe, as lasse of Kent.
See howe he venteth into the wynd.
Weenest of loue is not his mynd?
Seemeth thy flocke thy counsell can,
So lustlesse bene they, so weake so wan,
Clothed with cold, and hoary wyth frost.
Thy flocks father his corage hath lost:
Thy Ewes, that wont to haue blowen bags,
Like wailefull widdowes hangen their crags:
The rather Lambes bene starued with cold,
All for their Maister is lustlesse and old.

THENOT.

Cuddie, I wote thou kenst little good,
So vainely taduaunce thy headlesse hood.
For Youngth is a bubble blown vp with breath,
Whose witt is weakenesse, whose wage is death,
Whose way is wildernesse, whose ynne Penaunce,
And stoopegallaunt Age the hoste of Greeuaunce.
But shall I tel thee a tale of truth,
Which I cond of Tityrus in my youth,
Keeping his sheepe on the hils of Kent?

CVDDIE.

To nought more Thenot, my mind is bent,
Then to heare nouells of his deuise:
They bene so well thewed, and so wise,
What euer that good old man bespake.

<page sig="b1r">
THENOT.

Many meete tales of youth did he make,
And some of loue, and some of cheualrie:
But none fitter then this to applie.
Now listen a while, and hearken the end.

There grewe an aged Tree on the greene,
A goodly Oake sometime had it bene,
With armes full strong and largely displayd,
But of their leaues they were disarayde:
The bodie bigge, and mightely pight,
Throughly rooted, and of wonderous hight:
Whilome had bene the King of the field,
And mochell mast to the husband did yielde,
And with his nuts larded many swine.
But now the gray mosse marred his rine,
His bared boughes were beaten with stormes,
His toppe was bald, &#38; wasted with wormes,
His honor decayed, his braunches sere.

Hard by his side grewe a bragging brere,
Which proudly thrust into Thelement,
And seemed to threat the Firmament.
Yt was embellisht with blossomes fayre,
And thereto aye wonned to repayre
The shepheards daughters, to gather flowres,
To peinct their girlonds with his colowres.
And in his small bushes vsed to shrowde
The sweete Nightingale singing so lowde:
Which made this foolish Brere wexe so bold,
That on a time he cast him to scold,
And snebbe the good Oake, for he was old.

Why standst there (quoth he) thou brutish blocke?
Nor for fruict, nor for shadowe serues thy stocke:
Seest, how fresh my flowers bene spredde,
Dyed in Lilly white, and Cremsin redde,
With Leaues engrained in lusty greene,
Colours meete to clothe a mayden Queene.






</page>

<page sig="b1v">
Thy wast bignes but combers the grownd,
And dirks the beauty of my blossomes rownd.
The mouldie mosse, which thee accloieth,
My Sinamon smell too much annoieth.
Wherefore soone I rede thee, hence remoue,
Least thou the price of my displeasure proue.
So spake this bold brere with great disdaine:
Little him answered the Dake againe,
But yielded, with shame and greefe adawed,
That of a weede he was ouerawed.

Yt chaunced after vpon a day,
The Hus-bandman selfe to come that way,
Of custome for to seruewe his grownd,
And his trees of state in compasse rownd.
Him when the spitefull brere had espyed,
Caul lesse complained, and lowdly cryed
Vnto his Lord, stirring vp sterne strife:
O my liege Lord, the God of my life,
Pleaseth you ponder your Suppliants plaint,
Caused of wrong, and cruell constraint,
Which I your poore Vassall dayly endure:
And but your goodnes the same recure,
Am like for desperate doole to dye,
Through felonous force of mine enemie.

Greatly aghast with this piteous plea,
Him rested the goodman on the lea,
And badde the Brere in his plaint proceede.
With painted words tho gan this proude weede,
(As most vsen Ambitious folke:)
His colowred crime with craft to cloke.

Ah my soueraigne, Lord of creatures all,
Thou placer of plants both humble and tall,
Was not I planted of thine owne hand,
To be the primtose of all thy land,
With flowring blossemes, to furnish the prime,
And scarlot berries in Sommer time?
How falls it then, that this faded Oake,






</page>

<page sig="b2r">
Whose bodie is sere, whose braunches broke,
Whose naked Armes stretch vnto the fyre,
Vnto such tyrannie doth aspire:
Hindering with his shade my louely light,
And robbing me of the swete sonnes sight?
So beate his old boughes my tender side,
That oft the bloud springeth from wounds wyde:
Vntimely my flowres forced to fall,
That bene the honor of your Coronall.
And oft he lets his cancker wormes light
Vpon my braunches, to worke me more spight:
And oft his hoarie locks downe doth cast,
Where with my fresh flowretts bene defast,
For this, and many more such outrage,
Crauing your goodlihead to aswage
The ranckorous rigour of his might,
Nought aske I, but onely to hold my right:
Submitting me to your good sufferance,
And praying to be garded from greeuance.

To this the Oake cast him to replie
Well as he couth: but his enemie
Had kindled such coles of displeasure,
That the good man noulde stay his leasure,
But home him hasted with furious heate,
Eucreasing his wrath with many a threate.
His harmefull Hatchet he hent in hand,
(Alas, that it so ready should stand)
And to the field alone he speedeth.
(Ay little helpe to harme there needeth)
Anger nould let him speake to the tree,
Enaunter his rage mought cooled bee:
But to the roote bent his sturdy stroke,
And made many wounds in the wast Oake.
The Axes edge did oft turne againe,
As halfe vnwilling to cutte the graine:
Semed, the sencetesse yron dyd feare,
Or to wrong holy eld did forbeare.






</page>

<page sig="b2v">
For it had bene an auncient tree,
Sacred with many a mysteree,
And often crost with the priestes crewe,
And often halowed with holy water dewe.
But sike fancies weren foolerie,
And broughten this Oake to this miserye.
For nought mought they quitten him from decay:
For fiercely the good man at him did laye.
The blocke oft groned vnder the blow,
And sighed to see his neare ouerthrow.
In fine the steele had pierced his pitth,
Tho downe to the earth he fell forthwith:
His wonderous weight made the grounde to quake,
Thearth shronke vnder him, and seemed to shake.
There lyeth the Oake, pitied of none.

Now stands the Brere like a Lord alone,
Puffed vp with pryde and vaine pleasaunce:
But all this glee had no continuaunce.
For eftsones Winter gan to approche,
The blustring Boreas did encroche,
And beate vpon the solitarie Brere:
For nowe no succoure was seene him nere.
Now gan he repent his prvde to late:
For naked left and disconsolate,
The byting frost nipt his stalke dead,
The watrie wette weighed downe his head,
And heaped snowe burdned him so sore,
That nowe vpright he can stand no more:
And being downe, is trodde in the durt
Of cattell, and brouzed, and sorely hurt.
Such was thend of this Ambitious brere,
For scorning Eld

CVDDIE.

Now I pray thee shepheard, tel it not forth:
Here is a long tale, and little worth.
So longe haue I listened to thy speche,
That graffed to the ground is my breche:






</page>

<page sig="b3r">
My hartblood is welnigh frorne I feele,
And my galage growne fast to my heele:
But little ease of thy lewd tale I tasted.
Hye thee home shepheard, the day is nigh wasted.

Embleme.
This embleme is spoken of Thenot, as a moral of his former tale: namelye, that God, 
which is himselfe most aged, being before al ages, and without beginninge, 
maketh those, whom he loueth like to himselfe, in heaping yeares vnto theyre 
dayes, and blessing them wyth longe lyfe. For the blessing of age is not giuen 
to all, but vnto those, whome God will so blesse: and albeit that many euil m<expan type="">en</expan>
reache vnto such fulnesse of yeares, and some also wexe olde in myserie and 
thraldome, yet therefore is not age euer the lesse blessing. For euen to such euill 
men such number of yeares is added, that they may in their last dayes repent, 
and come to their first home. So the old man checketh the rashheaded boy, for 
despysing his gray and frostye heares.

Whom Cuddye doth counterbuff with a byting and bitter prouerbe, spoken indeede

<page sig="b4r">
at the first in co~tempt of old age generally. for it was an old opinion, and yet is 
c<expan type="">on</expan>tinued in some mens conceipt, that m<expan type="">en</expan> of yeares haue no feare of god at al, 
or not so much as younger folke. For that being rypened with long experience, 
and hauing passed many bitter brunts and blastes of vengeaunce, they dread 
no stormes of Fortune, nor wrathe of Gods, not daunger of menne, as being 
eyther by longe and ripe wisedome armed against all mischaunces and aduersi&#173;
tie, or with much trouble hardened against all troublesome tydes: lyke vnto 
the Ape, of which is sayd in &#198;sops fables, that oftentimes meeting the Lyon, he 
was at first sore aghast &#38; dismayed at the grimnes and austeritie of hys coun&#173;
tenance, but at last being acquainted with his lookes, he was so furre from fea&#173;
ring him, that he would familiarly gybe and iest with him: Suche longe experi<emend err="">&#173;</emend>
ence breedeth in some men securitie. Although it please Erasimus a great clerke 
and good old father, more fatherly and fauourablye to construe it in his Adages 
for his own behoofe, That by the prouerbe <term lang="la">Nemo Senex metuit Iouem</term>, is not 
meant, that old men haue no feare of God at al, but that they be furre from su&#173;
perstition and Idolatrous regard of false Gods, as is Iupiter. But his greate lear&#173;
ning notwithstanding, it is to plaine, to be gainsayd, that olde men are muche 
more enclined to such fond fooleries, then younger heades.

ARGVMENT.

IN this &#198;glogue two shepheards boyes taking occasion of the season, be&#173;
ginne to make purpose of loue and other plesaunce, which to spring time 
is most agreeable. The speciall meaning hereof is, to giue certaine markes

and tokens, to know Cupide the Poets God of Loue. But more particularlye I 
thinke, in the person of Thomalin is meant some secrete freend, who scorned 
Loue and his knights so long, till at length him selfe was entangled, and vn&#173;
wares wounded with the dart of some beautifull regard, which is Cupides 
arrowe.

<lemeformat>
Willye Thomalin.

THomalin, why sytten we soe,
As weren ouerwent with woe,
Vpon so fayre a morow?
The ioyous time now nighest fast,
That shall alegge this bitter blast,
And slake the winters sorowe.

Thomalin.

Sicker Willye, thou warnest well:
For Winters wrath beginnes to quell,
And pleasant spring appeareth.
The grasse nowe ginnes to be refresht,
The Swallow peepes out of her nest,
And clowdie Welkin cleareth.

Willye.

Seest not thilke same Hawthorne studde,
How bragly it beginnes to budde,
And vtter his tender head?
Flora now calleth forth eche flower,
And bids make ready Maias bowre,
That newe is vpryst from bedde.
Tho shall we sporten in delight,
And learne with Lettice to wexe light,
That scornefully lookes askaunce,
Tho will we little Loue awake,
That nowe sleepeth in Lethe lake,
And pray him leaden our daunce.

Thomalin.

Willye, I wene thou bee assott:
For lustie Loue still sleepeth not,
But is abroad at his game.

Willye.

How kenst thou, that he is awoke?






</page>

<page sig="c1r">
Or hast thy selfe his slomber broke?
Or made preuie to the same?

Thomalin.

No, but happely I hym spyde,
Where in a bush he did him hide,
With winges of purple and blewe.
And were not, that my sheepe would stray,
The preuie marks I would bewray,
Whereby by chaunce I him knewe.

Willye.

Thomalin, haue no care for thy,
My selfe will haue a double eye,
Ylike to my flocke and thine:
For als at home I haue a syre,
A stepdame eke as whott as fyre,
That dewly adayes counts mine.

Thomalin.

Nay, but thy seeing will not serue,
My sheepe for that may chaunce to swerue,
And fall into some mischiefe.
For sithens is but the third morowe,
That I chaunst to fall a sleepe with sorowe,
And waked againe with griefe:
The while thilke same vnhappye Ewe,
Whose clouted legge her hurt doth shewe,
Fell headlong into a dell,
And there vnioynted both her bones:
Mought her necke bene ioynted attones,
She shoulde haue neede no more spell.
Thelf was so wanton aud so wood,
(But now I trowe can better good)
She mought ne gang on the greene,

Willye.

Let be, as may be, that is past:
That is to come, let be forecast.
Now tell vs, what thou hast seene.

Thomalin.

When shepheardes groomes han leaue to playe,
I cast to goe a shooting.
Long wandring vp and downe the land,
With bowe and bolts in either hand,
For birds in bushes tooting:
At length within an Yuie todde
(There shrouded was the little God)
I heard a busie bustling.
I bent my bolt against the bush,
Listening if any thing did rushe,
But then heard no more rustling.
Tho peeping close into the thicke,
Might see the mouing of some quicke,
Whose shape appeared not:
But were it faerie, feend, or snake,
My courage earnd it to awake,
And manfully thereat shotte.
With that sprong forth a naked swayne,
With spotted winges like Peacocks trayne,
And laughing lope to a tree.
His gylden quiuer at his backe,
And siluer bowe, which was but slacke,
Which lightly he bent at me.
That seeing I, leuelde againe,
And shott at him with might and maine,
As thicke, as it had hayled.
So long I shott, that al was spent:
Tho pumie stones I hastly hent,
And threwe: but nought availed:
He was so wimble, and so wight,
From bough to bough he lepped light,
And oft the pumies latched.
Therewith affrayd I ranne away:
But he, thast earst seemd but to playe,
A shaft in earnest snatched,
And hit me running in the heele:
For then I little smart did feele:

<page sig="c2r">
But soone it sore encreased.
And now it ranckleth more and more,
And inwardly it festreth sore,
Ne wote I, how to cease it.

Willye.

Thomalin, I pittie thy plight.
Perdie with loue thou diddest fight:
I know him by a token.
For once I heard my father say,
How he him caught vpon a day,
(Whereof he wilbe wroken)
Entangled in a fowling net,
Which he for carrion Crowes had set,
That in our Peeretree haunted.
Tho sayd, he was a winged lad,
But bowe and shaftes as then none had:
Els had he sore be daunted.
But see the Welkin thicks apace,
And stouping Phebus steepes his face:
Yts time to hast vs homeward.

Willyes Embleme.

To be wise and eke to loue,
Is graunted scarce to God aboue.

Thomalins Embleme.

Of Hony and of Gaule in loue there is store:
The Honye is much, but the Gaule is more.

THis &#198;glogue is purposely intended to the honor and prayse of our most 
gracious souereigne, Queene Elizabeth. The speakers herein be Hobbi&#173;
noll and Thenott, two shepheardes: the which Hobbinoll being before men&#173;
tioned, greatly to haue loued Colin, is here set forth more largely, complay&#173;
ning him of that boyes great misaduenture in Loue, whereby his mynd was 
alienate and with drawen not onely from him, who moste loued him, but also 
from all former delightes and studies, as well in pleasaunt pyping, as conning 
ryming and singing, and other his laudable exercises. Whereby he taketh 
occasion, for proofe of his more excellencie and skill in poetrie, to recorde a 
songe, which the sayd Colin sometime made in honor of her Maiestie, whom 
abruptely be termeth Elysa.

 Thenot. Hobbinoll.

TEll me good Hobbinoll, what garres thee greete?
What? hath some Wolfe thy tender Lambes ytorne?
Or is thy Bagpype broke, that soundes so sweete?
Or art thou of thy loued lasse forlorne?

Or bene thine eyes attempred to the yeare,
Quenching the gasping furrowes thirst with rayne?

YE dayntye Nymphs, that in this blessed Brooke
doe bathe your brest,
For sake your watry bowres, and hether looke,
at my request:
And eke you Virgins, that on Parnasse dwell,
Whence floweth Helicon the learned well,
Helpe me to blaze
Her worthy praise,
Which in her sexe doth all excell.

Of fayre Elisa be your siluer song,
that blessed wight:
The flowre of Virgins, may shee florish long,
In princely plight.
For shee is Syrinx daughter without spotte,
Which Pan the shepheards God of her begot:
So sprong her grace
Of heauenly race,
No mortall blemishe may her blotte.

See, where she sits vpon the grassie greene,
(O seemely sight)
Yclad in Scarlot like a mayden Queene,
And Ermines white.
Vpon her head a Cremosin coronet,
With Damaske roses and Daffadillies set:
Bayleaues betweene,
And Primroses greene
Embellish the sweete Violet.

Tell me, haue ye seene her angelick face,
Like Ph&#339;be fayre?
Her heauenly haueour, her princely grace

In either cheeke depeincten liuely chere.

He blusht to see another Sunne belowe,
Ne durst againe his fyrye face out showe:
Let him, if he dare,
His brightnesse compare
With hers, to haue the ouerthrowe.

Shewe thyselfe Cynthia with thy siluer rayes,
and be not abasht:
When shee the beames of her beauty displayes,
O how art thou dasht?
But I will not match her with Latonaes seede,
Such follie great sorow to Niobe did breede.
Now she is a stone,

Warning all other to take heede.

Pan may be proud, that euer he begot

And after her the other Muses trace,

Palinode.  Piers,

IS not thilke the mery moneth of May,
When loue lads mas ken in fresh aray?
How falles it then, we no merrier bene,
Ylike as others, girt in gawdy greene?
Our bloncket liueryes bene all to sadde,
For thilke same season, when all is ycladd
With pleasaunce: the grownd with grasse, the Wods
With greene leaues, the bushes with bloosming Buds.
Yougthes folke now flocken in euery where,
To gather may bus-kets and smelling brere:
And home they hasten the postes to dight,
And all the Kirke pillours eare day light,
With Hawthorne buds, and swete Eglantine,
And girlonds of roses and Sopps in wine.
Such merimake holy Saints doth queme,
But we here sytten as drownd in a dreme.

PIERS.

For Younkers Palinode such follies fitte,
But we tway bene men of elder witt.

PALINODE.

Sicker this morrowe, ne lenger agoe,
I sawe a shole of shepeheardes outgoe,
With singing, and shouting, and iolly chere:
Before them yode a lusty Tabrere,
That to the many a Horne pype playd,
Whereto they dauncen eche one with his mayd.
To see those folkes make such iouysaunce,
Made my heart after the pype to daunce.
Tho to the greene Wood they speeden hem all,
To fetchen home May with their musicall:
And home they bringen in a royall throne,
Crowned as king: and his Queene attone
Was Lady Flora, on whom did attend
A fayre flocke of Facries, and a fresh bend






</page>

<page sig="e1r">
Of louely Nymphs. (O that I were there,
To helpen the Ladyes their Maybush beare)
Ah Piers, bene not thy teeth on edge, to thinke,
How great sport they gaynen with little swinck.

PIERS.

Perdie so farre am I from enuie,
That their fondnesse inly I pitie.
Those faytours little regarden their charge,
While they letting their sheepe runne at large,
Passen their time, that should be sparely spent,
In lustihede and wanton meryment.
Thilke same bene shepeheards for the Deuils stedde.
That playen, while their flockes be vnfedde.
Well is it seene, theyr sheepe bene not their owne,
That letten them runne at randon alone.
But they bene hyred for little pay
Of other, that caren as little as they,
What fallen the flocke, so they han the fleece,
And get all the gayne, paying but a peece.
I muse, what account both these will make,
The one for the hire, which he doth take,
And thother for leauing his Lords tas-ke,
When gread Pan account of shepeherdes shall as-ke.

PALINODE.

Sicker now I see thou speakest of spight,
All for thou lackest somedele their delight.
I (as I am) had rather be enuied,
All were it of my foe, then fonly pitied:
And yet if neede were, pitied would be,
Rather, then other should scorne at me:
For pittied is mishappe, that nas remedie,
But scorned bene dedes of fond foolerie.
What shoulden shepheards other things tend,
Then sith their God his good does them send,
Reapen the fruite thereof, that is pleasure,
The while they here liuen, at ease and leasure?
For when they bene dead, their good is ygoe,






</page>

<page sig="e1v">
They sleepen in rest, well as other moe.
Tho with them wends, what they spent in cost,
But what they left behind them, is lost.
Good is no good, but if it be spend:
God <emend err="giuethgood">giueth good</emend> for none other end.

PIERS.

Ah Palinodie, thou art a worldes childe:
Who touches Pitch mought needes be defilde.
But shepheards (as Algrind vsed to say,)
Mought not liue ylike, as men of the laye:
With them it sits to care for their heire,
Enaunter their heritage doe impaire:
They must prouide for meanes of maintenaunce,
And to continue their wont countenaunce.
But shepheard must walke another way,
Sike wordly souenance he must foresay.
The sonne of his loines why should should he regard
To leaue enriched with that he hath spard?
Should not thilke God, that gaue him that good,
Eke cherish his child, if in his wayes he stood?
For if he misliue in leudnes and lust,
Little bootes all the welth and the trust,
That his father left by iuheritaunce:
All will be soone wasted with misgouernaunce.
But through this, and other their miscreaunce,
They maken many a wrong cheuisaunce,
Heaping by waues of welth and woe,
The floddes whereof shall them ouerflow.
Sike mens follie I cannot compare
Better, then to the Apes folish care,
That is so enamoured of her young one,
(And yet God wote, such cause hath she none.)
That with her hard hold, and straight embracing,
She stoppeth the breath of her youngling.
So often times, when as good is meant,
Euil ensueth of wrong entent.

The time was once, and may againe retorne,






</page>

<page sig="e2r">
(For ought may happen, that hath bene beforne)
When shepeheards had none inheritaunce,
Ne of land, nor fee in sufferaunce:
But what might arise of the bare sheepe,
(Were it more or lesse) which they did keepe.
Well ywis was it with shepheards thoe:
Nought hauing, nought feared they to forgoe.
For Pan himselfe was their inheritaunce,
And little them serued for their mayntenaunce.
The shephears God so wel them guided,
That of nought they were vnprouided,
Butter enough, honye, milke, and whay,
And their flockes fleeces, them to araye.
But tract of time, and long prosperitie:
That nource of vice, this of insolencie,
Lulled the shepheards in such securitie,
That not content with loyall obeysaunce,
Some gan to gape for greedie gouernaunce,
And match them selfe with mighty potentates,
Louers of Lordship and troublers of states:
Tho gan shepheards swaines to looke a loft,
And leaue to liue hard, and learne to ligge soft:
Tho vnder colour of shepeheards, somewhile
There crept in Wolues, ful of fraude and guile,
That often deuoured their owne sheepe,
And often the shepheards, that did hem keepe.
This was the first sourse of shephear ds sorowe,
That now nill be quitt with baile, nor borrowe.

PALINODE.

Three thinges to beare, bene very burdenous,
But the fourth to forbeare, is outragious.
Wemen that of Loues longing once lust,
Hardly forbearen, but haue it they must:
So when choler is inflamed with rage,
Wanting reuenge, is hard to asswage:
And who can counsell a thristie soule,
With patience to forbeare the offred bowle?






</page>

<page sig="e2v">
But of all burdens, that a man can beare,
Moste is, a fooles talke to beare and to heare.
I wene the Geaunt has not such a weight,
That beares on his shoulders the heauens height.
Thou findest faulte, where nys to be found,
And buildest strong warke vpon a weake ground:
Thou raylest on right withouten reason,
And blamest hem much, for small encheason.
How shoulden shepheardes liue, if not so?
What? should they pynen in payne and woe?
Nay sayd I thereto, by my deare borrowe,
If I may rest, I nill liue in sorrowe.

Sorrowe ne neede be hastened on:
For he will come without calling anone.
While times enduren of tranquillitie,
Vsen we freely our felicitie.
For when approchen the stormie stowres,
We mought with our shoulders beare of the sharpe showres.
And sooth to sayne, nought seemeth sike strife,
That shepheardes so witen ech others life,
And layen her faults the world beforne,
The while their foes done eache of hem scorne.
Let none mislike of that may not be mended:
So conteck soone by concord mought be ended.

PIERS.

Shepheard, I list none accordaunce make
With shepheard, that does the right way forsake.
And of the twaine, if choice were to me,
Had leuer my foe, then my freend he be.
For what concord han light and darke sam?
Or what peace has the Lion with the Lambe?
Such faitors, when their false harts bene bidde.
Will doe, as did the Foxe by the Kidde.

PALINODE.

Now Piers, of felowship, tell vs that saying:
For the Ladde can keepe both our flocks from straying.

<page sig="e3r">
PIERS.

THilke same Kidde (as I can well deuise)
Was too very foolish and vnwise.
For on a tyme in Sommer season,
The Gate her dame, that had good reason.
Yode forth abroade vnto the greene wood,
To brouze, or play, or what shee thought good.
But for she had a motherly care
Of her young sonne; and wit to beware,
Shee set her youngling before her knee,
That was both fresh and louely to see,
And full of fauour, as kidde mought be:
His Vellet head began to shoote out,
And his wreathed hornes gan newly sprout:
The blossomes of lust to bud did beginne,
And spring forth ranckly vnder his chinne.

My sonne (quoth she) (and with that gan weepe:
For carefull thoughts in her heart did creepe)
God blesse thee poore Orphane, as he mought me,
And send thee ioy of thy iollitee
Thy father (that word she spake with payne:
For a sigh had nigh rent her heart in twaine)
Thy father, had he liued this day,
To see the braunche of his body displaie,
How would he haue ioyed at this sweete sight?
But ah false Fortune such ioy did him spight,
And cutte of hys dayes with vntimely woe,
Betraying him into the traines of hys foe.
Now I a waylfull widdowe behight,
Of my old age haue this one delight,
To see thee succeede in thy fathers steade,
And florish in flowres of lusty head.
For euen so thy father his head vpheld,
And so his hauty hornes did he weld.

Tho marking him with melting eyes,
A thrilling throbbe from her hart did aryse,
And interrupted all her other speache,






</page>

<page sig="e3v">
With some old sorowe, that made a newe breache:
Seemed shee sawe in the younglings face
The old line aments of his fathers grace.
At last her solein silence she broke,
And gan his newe budded beard to stroke

Kiddie (quoth shee) thou kenst the great care,
I haue of thy health and thy welfare,
Which many wyld beastes liggen in waite,
For to entrap in thy tender state:
But most the Foxe, maister of collusion:
For he has voued thy last confusion.
For thy my Kiddie be ruld by mee,
And neuer giue trust to his trecheree.
And if he chaunce come, when I am abroade,
Sperre the yate fast for feare of fraude:
Ne for all his worst, nor for his best,
Open the dore at his request.

So schooled the Gate her wanton sonne,
That answerd his mother, all should be done.
Tho went the pensife Damme out of dore,
And chaunst to stomble at the threshold flore:
Her stombling steppe some what her amazed,
(For such, as signes of ill luck bene dispraised)
Yet forth shee yode thereat halfe aghast:
And Kiddie the dore sperred after her fast.
It was not long, after shee was gone,
But the false Foxe came to the dore anone:
Not as a Foxe, for then he had be kend,
But all as a poore pedler he did wend,
Bearing a trusse of tryfles at hys backe,
As bells, and babes, and glasses in hys packe.
A Biggen he had got about his brayne,
For in his headpeace he felt a sore payne.
His hinder heele was wrapt in a clout,
For with great cold he had gotte the gout.
There at the dore he cast me downe hys pack,
And layd him downe, and groned, Alack, Alack.






</page>

<page sig="e4r">
Ah deare Lord, and sweete Saint Charitee,
That some good body woulde once pitie mee.

Well heard Kiddie al this sore constraint,
And lengd to know the cause of his complaint:
Tho creeping close behind the Wickets clinck,
Preuelie he peeped out through a chinck:
Yet not so preuilie, but the Foxe him spyed:
For deceifull meaning is double eyed.

Ah good young master (then gan he crye)
Iesus blesse that sweete face, I espye,
And keepe your corpse from the carefull stounds,
That in my carrion carcas abounds.
The Kidd pittying hys heauinesse,
Asked the cause of his great distresse,
And also who, and whence that he were,
Tho he, that had well ycond his lere,
Thus medled his talke with many a teare,
Sicke, sicke, alas, and little lack of dead,
But I be relieued by your beastlyhead.
I am a poore Sheepe, albe my coloure donne:
For with long traueile I am brent in the sonne.
And if that my Grandsire me sayd, be true,
Sicker I am very sybbe to you:
So be your goodlihead doe not disdayne
The base kinred of so simple swaine.
Of mercye and fauour then I you pray,
With your ayd to forstall my necre decay.

Tho out of his packe a glasse he tooke:
Wherein while kiddie vnwares did looke,
He was so enamored with the newell,
That nought he deemed deare for the iewell.
Tho opened he the dore, and in came
The false Foxe, as he were starke lame.
His tayle he clapt betwixt his legs twayne,
Lest he should be descried by his trayne.

Being within, the Kidde made him good glee,
All for the loue of the glasse he did see.






</page>

<page sig="e4v">
After his chere the Pedler can chat,
And tell many lesings of this, and that:
And how he could shewe many a fine knack.
Tho shewed his ware, and opened his packe,
All saue a bell, which he left behind
In the bas-ket for the Kidde to fynd.
Which when the Kidde stooped downe to catch,
He popt him in, and his bas-ket did latch,
Ne stayed he once, the dore to make fast,
But ranne awaye with him in all hast.
Home when the doubtfull Damme had her hyde,
She mought see the dore stand open wyde.
All agast, lowdly she gan to call
Her Kidde: but he nould answere at all.
Tho on the flore she sawe the merchandise,
Of which her sonne had sette to dere a prise.
What helpe? her Kidde shee knewe well was gone:
Shee weeped, and wayled, and made great mone.
Such end had the Kidde, for he nould warned be
Of craft, coloured with simplicitie:
And such end perdie does all hem remayne,
That of such falsers freendship bene fayne.

PALINODIE.

Truly Piers, thou art beside thy wit,
Furthest fro the marke, weening it to hit,
Now I pray thee, lette me thy tale borrowe
For our sir Iohn, to say to morrowe
At the Kerke, when it is holliday:
For well he meanes, but little can say.
But and if Foxes bene so crafty, as so,
Much needeth all shepheards hem to knowe.

PIERS.

Of their falshode more could I recount.
But now the bright Sunne gynneth to dismount:
And for the deawie night now doth nye,
I hold it best for vs, home to hye.

Pan signifieth all or omnipotent, which is onely the Lord lesus. And by that 
name (as I remember) he is called of Eusebius in his fifte booke de Preparat. E&#173;
uang; who thereof telleth a proper storye to that purpose. Which story is first 
recorded of Plutarch, in his booke of the ceasing of oracles, &#38; of Lauetere tran&#173;
slated, in his booke of walking sprightes. who sayth, that about the same time, 
that our Lord suffered his most bitter passion for the redemtion of man, certein 
passengers sayling from Italy to Cyprus and passing by certain Iles called Pax&#230;, 
heard a voyce calling alowde Thamus, Thamus, (now Thamus was the name 
of an &#198;gyptian, which was Pilote of the ship,) who giuing eare to the cry, was 
bidden, when he came to Palodes, to tel, that the great Pan was dead: which 
he doubting to doe, yet for that when he came to Palodes, there sodeinly was 
such a calme of winde, that the shippe stoode still in the sea vnmoued, he was 
forced to cry alowd, that Pan was dead: wherewithall there was heard suche 
piteous outcryes and dreadfull shriking, as hath not bene the like. By whych 
Pan, though of some be vnderstoode the great Satanas, whose kingdome at that 
time was by Christ conquered, the gates of hell broken vp, and death by death
deliuered to eternall death, (for at that time, as he sayth, all Oracles surceased, 
and enchaunted spirits, that were wont to delude the people, thenceforth held 
theyr peace) &#38; also at the demaund of the Emperoure Tiberius, who that Pan 
should be, answere was made him by the wisest and best learned, that it was 
the sonne of Mercurie and Penelope, yet I think it more properly meant of the 
death of Christ, the onely and very Pan, then suffering for his flock.

Embleme. Both these Emblemes make one whole Hexametre. The first spoken of Palinodie, as in 
reproche of them, that be distrustfull, is a peece of Theognis verse, intending, 
that who doth most mistrust is most false. For such experience in falsehod bree&#173;
deth mistrust in the mynd, thinking nolesse guile to lurke in others, then in hym&#173;
selfe. But Piers thereto strongly replyeth with another peece of the same verse, 
saying as in his former fable, what fayth then is there in the faythlesse. For if 
fayth be the ground of religion, which fayth they dayly false, what hold then is 
there of theyr religion. And thys is all that they saye.

ARGVMENT.

THis &#198;glogue is wholly vowed to the complayning of Colins ill soccesse 
in his loue. For being (as is aforesaid) enamoured of a Country lasse Ro<emend err="">&#173;</emend> 
salind, and hauing (as seemeth) founde place in her heart, he lamenteth to 
his deare frend Hobbinoll, that he is nowe forsaken vnfaithfully, and in 
his steede Menalcas, another shepheard receiued disloyally. And this is the 
whole Argument of this &#198;glogue.

HOBBINOL.          COLIN Cloute.

LO Collin, here the place, whose pleasaunt syte
From other shades hath weand my wandring mynde,
Tell me, what wants me here, to worke delyte?
The simple ayre, the gentle warbling wynde,
So calme, so coole, as no where else I fynde:
The grassye gronnd with daintye Daysies dight,
The Bramble bush, where Byrds of euery kynde
To the waters fall their tunes attemper right.

COLLIN.

O happy Hobbinoll, I blesse thy state,
That Paradise hast found, whych Adam lost.
Here wander may thy flock early or late,
Withouten dreade of Wolues to bene ytost:
Thy louely layes here mayst thou freely boste.
But I vnhappy man, whom cruell fate,
And angry Gods pursue from coste to coste,
Can nowhere fynd, to shouder my lucklesse pate.

HOBBINOLL.

Then if by me thou list aduised be,
Forsake the soyle, that so doth the bewitch:
Leaue me those hilles, where harbrough nis to see,
Nor holybush, nor brere, nor winding witche:
And to the dales resort, where shipheards ritch,
And fruictfull flocks bene euery where to see.
Here no night Rauene lodge more black then pitche,
Nor eluish ghosts, nor gastly owles doe flee.

But frendly Faeries, met with many Graces,
And lightfote Nymphes can chace the lingring night,
With Heydeguyes, and trimly trodden traces,
Whilst systers nyne, which dwell on Parnasse hight,
Doe make them musick, for their more delight:
And Pan himselfe to kisse their christall faces,
Will pype and daunce, when Ph&#339;be shineth bright:
Such pierlesse pleasures haue we in these places.

COLLIN.

And I, whylst youth, and course of carelesse yeeres






</page>

<page sig="f3v">
Did let me walke withouten lincks of loue,
In such delights did ioy amongst my peeres:
But ryper age such pleasures doth reproue,
My fancye eke from former follies moue
To stayed steps. for time in passing weares
(As garments doen, which wexen old aboue)
And draweth newe delightes with hoary heares.

Tho couth I sing of loue, and tune my pype
Vnto my plaintiue pleas in verses made:
Tho would I seeke for Queene apples vnrype,
To giue my Rosalind, and in Sommet shade
Dight gaudy Girlonds, was my comen trade,
To crowne her golden locks, vnt yeeres more rype,
And losse of her, whose loue as lyfe I wayd,
Those weary wanton toyes away dyd wype.

HOBBINOLL.

Colin, to heare thy rymes and roundelayes,
Which thou were wont on wastfull hylls to singe,
I more delight, then larke in Sommer dayes:
Whose Echo made the neyghbour groues to ring,
And taught the byrds, which in the lower spring
Did shroude in shady leaues from sonny rayes,
Frame to thy songe their chereful cheriping,
Or hold theyr peace, for shame of thy swete layes.

I sawe Calliope wyth Muses moe,
Soone as thy oaten pype began to sound,
Theyr yuory Luyts and Tamburins forgoe:
And from the fountaine, where they sat around,
Renne after hastely thy siluer sound.
But when they came, where thou thy skill didst showe,
They drewe abacke, as halfe with shame confound,
Shepheard to see, them in theyr art outgoe.

COLLIN.

Of Muses Hobbinol, I conne no skill:
For they bene daughters of the hyghest Ioue.
And holden scorne of homely shepheards quill.

<page sig="f4r">
For sith I heard, that Pan with Ph&#339;bus stroue,
Which him to much rebuke and Daunger droue:
I neuer lyst presume to Parnasse hyll,
But pyping lowe in shade of lowly groue,
I play to please my selfe, all be it ill.

Nought weigh I, who my song doth prayse or blame,
Ne striue to winne renowne, or passe the rest:
With shepheard sittes not, followe flying fame:
But feede his flocke in fields, where falls hem best.
I wote my rymes bene rough, and rudely drest:
The fytter they, my carefull case to frame:
Enough is me to paint out my vnrest,
And poore my piteous plaints out in the same.

The God of shepheards Tityrus is dead,
Who taught me homely, as I can, to make.
He, whilst he liued, was the soueraigne head
Of shepheards all, that bene with loue ytake:
Well couth he wayle hys Woes, and lightly slake
The flames, which loue within his heart had bredd,
And tell vs mery tales, to keepe vs wake,
The while our sheepe about vs safely fedde.

Nowe dead he is, and lyeth wrapt in lead,
(O why should death on hym such outrage showe?)
And all hys passing skil with him is fledde,
The fame whereof doth dayly greater growe.
But if on me some little drops would flowe,
Of that the spring was in his learned hedde,
I soone would learne these woods, to wayle my woe,
And teache the trees, their trickling teares to shedde.

Then should my plaints, causd of discurtesee,
As messengers of all my painfull plight,
Flye to my loue, where euer that she bee,
And pierce her heart with poynt of worthy wight:
As shee deserues, that wrought so deadly spight.






</page>

<page sig="f4v">
And thou Menalcas, that by trecheree
Didst vnderfong my lasse, to wexe so light,
Shouldest well be knowne for such thy villance.

But since I am not, as I wish I were,
Ye gentle shepheards, which your flocks do feede,
Whether on hylls, or dales, or other where,
Beare witnesse all of thys so wicked deede:
And tell the lasse, whose flowre is woxe a weede,
And faultlesse fayth, is turned to faithlesse fere,
That she the truest shepheards hart made bleede,
That lyues on earth, and loued her most dere.

HOBBINOL.

O carefull Colin, I lament thy case,
Thy teares would make the hardest flint to flowe.
Ah faithlesse Rosalind, and voide of grace,
That art the roote of all this ruthfull woe.
But now is time, I gesse, home ward to goe:
Then ryse ye blessed flocks, and home apace,
Least night with stealing steppes do you forsloe,
And wett your tender Lambes, that by you trace.

Embleme. 
You remember, that in the fyrst &#198;glogue, Colins Poesie was Anchora speme: for that 
as then there was hope of fauour to be found in tyme. But nowe being cleane 
forlorne and reiected of her, as whose hope, that was, is cleane extinguished and 
turned into despeyre, he renounceth all comfort and hope of goodnesse to 
come. which is all the meaning of thys Embleme.

ARGVMENT.

THis &#198;glogue is made in the honour and commendation of good shepe&#173;
heardes, and to the shame and disprayse of proude and ambitious Pa&#173;
stours. Such as Morrell is here imagined to bee.

<lemeformat>
Thomalin.       Morrell.

IS not thilke same a goteheard prowde, 
    that sittes on yonder bancke,
Whose straying heard them selfe doth shrowde 
    emong the bushes rancke?

Morrell.

What ho, thou iollye shepheards swayne, 
    come vp the hyll to me:
Better is, then the lowly playne, 
    als for thy flocke, and thee.

Thomalin.

Ah God shield, man, that I should clime, 
    and learne to looke alofte,
This reede is ryfe, that oftentime 
    Great clymbers fall vnsoft.

In humble dales is footing fast, 
    the trode is not so trickle:
And though one fall through heedlesse hast, 
    yet is his misse not mickle.
And now the Sonne hath reared vp 
    his fyriefooted teme,
Making his way betweene the Cuppe, 
    and golden Diademe:
The rampant Lyon hunts he fast, 
    with Dogge of noysome breath,
Whose balefull barking bringes in hast 
    pyne, plagues, and dreery death.
Agaynst his cruell scortching heate 
    where hast thou couerture?
The wastefull hylls vnto his threate 
    is a playne ouerture.
But if thee lust, to holden chat 
    with seely shepherds swayne,
Come downe, and learne the little what, 
    that Thomalin can sayne.

Morrell.

Syker, thous but a laesie loord, 
    and rekes much of thy swinck,
That with fond termes, and weetlesse words 
    to blere myne eyes doest thinke.
In euill houre thou hentest in hond 
    thus holy hylles to blame,
For sacred vnto saints they stond, 
    and of them han theyr name.
S. Michels mount who does not know, 
    that wardes the Westerne coste?
And of S. Brigets bowre. I trow, 
    all Kent can rightly boaste:
And they that con of Muses skill, 
    sayne most what, that they dwell
(As goteheards wont) vpon a hill, 
    beside a learned well.

And wonned not the great God Pan, 
    vpon mount Oliuet:
Feeding the blessed flocke of Dan, 
    which dyd himselfe beget?

Thomalin.

O blessed sheepe, O shepheard great, 
    that bought his flocke so deare,
And them did saue with bloudy sweat 
    from Wolues, that would them teare.

Morrel.

Besyde, as holy fathers sayne, 
    there is a hyllye place,
Where Titan ryseth from the mayne, 
    to renne hys dayly race.
Vpon whose toppe the starres bene stayed, 
    and all the skie doth leane,
There is the caue, where Phebe layed, 
    the shepheard long to dreame.
Whilome there vsed shepheards all 
    to feede theyr flocks at will,
Till by his foly one did fall, 
    that all the rest did spill.
And sithens shepheardes bene foresayd 
    from places of delight:
For thy I weene thou be affrayd, 
    to clune this hilles height.
Of Synah can I tell thee more, 
    And of our Ladyes bowre:
But little needes to strow my store, 
    suffice this hill of our.
Here han the holy Faunes resourse, 
    and Syluanes haunten rathe.
Here has the salt Medway his sourse, 
    wherein the Nymphes doe bathe.
The salt Medway, that trickling stremis 
    adowne the dales of Kent:

<page sig="">
Till with his elder brother Themis 
    His brackish waues be meynt.
Here growes Melampode euery where, 
    and Teribinth good for Gotes:
The one, my madding kiddes to smere, 
    the next, to heale theyr throtes.
Hereto, the hills bene nigher heuen, 
    and thence the passage ethe.
As well can proue the piercing leuin, 
    that seeldome falls bynethe.

Thomalin.

Syker thou speakes lyke a lewde lorrell, 
    of Heauen to demen so:
How be I am but rude and borrell, 
    yet nearer wayes I knowe.
To Kerke the narre, from God more farre, 
    has bene an old sayd fawe.
And he that striues to touch the starres, 
    oft stombles at a strawe,
Alsoone may shepheard clymbe to skye, 
    that leades in lowly dales,
As Goteherd prowd that sitting hye, 
    vpon the Moimtaine sayles.
My seely sheepe like well belowe, 
    they neede not Melampode:
For they bene hale enough, I trowe, 
    and liken theyr abode,
But if they with thy Gotes should yede, 
    they soone myght be corrupted:
Or like not of the frowie fede, 
    or with the weedes be glutted.
The hylls, where dwelled holy saints, 
    I reuerence and adore:
Not for themselfe, but for the sayncts, 
    Which han be dead of yore.
And nowe they bene to heauen forewent, 
    theyr good is with them goe:

<page sig="">
Theyr sample onely to vs lent, 
    That als we mought doe soe.
Shepheards they weren of the best, 
    and liued in lowlye leas:
And sith theyr soules bene now at rest, 
    why done we them disease?
Such one he was, (as I haue heard 
    old Algrind often sayne)
That whilome was the first shepheard, 
    and liued with little gayne:
As meeke he was, as meeke mought be, 
    simple, as simple sheepe,
Humble, and like in eche degree 
    the flocke, which he did keepe.
Often he vsed of hys keepe 
    a sacrifice to bring,
Nowe with a Kidde, now with a sheepe 
    the Altars hallowing.
So lowted he vnto hys Lord, 
    such fauour couth he fynd,
That sithens neuer was abhord, 
    the simple shepheards kynd.
And such I weene the brethren were, 
    that came from Canaan:
The brethren twelue, that kept yfere 
    the flockes of mighty Pan.
But nothing such thilk shephearde was, 
    whom Ida hyll dyd beare,
That left hys flocke, to fetch a lasse, 
    whose loue he bought to deare:
For he was proude, that ill was payd, 
    (no such mought shepheards bee)
And with lewde lust was ouerlayd: 
    tway things doen ill agree:
But shepheard mought be meeke and mylde, 
    well eyed, as Argus was,






</page>

<page sig="">
With fleshly follyes vndefyled, 
    and stoute as steede of brasse.
Sike one (sayd Algrin) Moses was, 
    that sawe hys makers face,
His face more cleare, then Christall glasse, 
    and spake to him in place.
This had a brother, (his name I knewe) 
    the first of all his cote,
A shepheard trewe, yet not so true, 
    as he that earst I hote.
Whilome all these were lowe, and lief, 
    and loued their flocks to feede,
They neuer strouen to be chiefe, 
    and simple was theyr weede.
But now (thanked be God therefore) 
    the world is well amend,
Their weedes bene not so nighly wore, 
    such simplesse mought them shend:
They bene yclad in purple and pall, 
    so hath theyr god them blist,
They reigne and rulen ouer all, 
    and lord it, as they list:
Ygyrt with belts of glitterand gold. 
    (mought they good sheepeheards bene)
Theyr Pan theyr sheepe to them has sold, 
    I saye as some haue seene.
For Palinode (if thou him ken) 
    yode late on Pilgrimage
To Rome, (if such be Rome) and then 
    he sawe thilke misusage.
For shepeheards (sayd he) there doen leade, 
    as Lordes done other where,
Theyr sheepe han crustes, and they the bread: 
    the chippes, and they the chere:
They han the fleece, and eke the flesh, 
    (O seely sheepe the while)
The corne is theyre, let other thresh, 
    their hands they may not file.






</page>

<page sig="">
They han great stores, and thriftye stockes, 
    great freendes and feeble foes:
What neede hem caren for their flocks? 
    theyr boyes can looke to those.
These wisards weltre in welths waues, 
    pampred in pleasures deepe,
They han fatte kernes, and leany knaues, 
    their fasting flockes to keepe.
Sike mister men bene all misgone, 
    they heapen hylles of wrath:
Sike syrlye shepheards han we none, 
    they keepen all the path.

Morrell.

Here is a great deale of good matter, 
    lost for lacke of telling,
Now sicker I see, thou doest but clatter: 
    harme may come of melling.
Thou medlest more, then shall haue thanke, 
    to wyten shepheards welth:
When folke bene fat, and riches rancke, 
    it is a signe of helth.
But say me, what is Algrin he, 
    that is so oft bynempt.

Thomalin.

He is a shepheard great in gree. 
    but hath bene long ypent.
One daye he sat vpon a hyll, 
    (as now thou wouldest me:
But I am taught by Algrins ill, 
    to loue the lowe degree.)
For sitting so with bared scalpe, 
    An Eagle sored hye,
That weening hys whyte head was chalke, 
    a shell fish downe let flye:
She weend the shell fishe to haue broake, 
    but therewith bruzd his brayne,
So now astonied with the stroke, 
    he lyes in lingring payne.






</page>

<page sig="">
Morrell.

Ah good Algrin, his hap was ill, 
    but shall be better in time.
Now farwell shepheard, sith thys hyll 
    thou hast such doubt to climbe.

Embleme. 
By thys poesye Thomalin confirmeth that, which in hys former speach by sondrye rea&#173;
sons he had proued for being both hymselfe sequestred from all ambition and 
also abhorring it in others of hys cote, he taketh occasion to prayse the meane 
and lowly state, as that wherein is safetie without feare, and quiet without dan<emend err="">&#173;</emend>
ger, according to the saying of olde Philosophers, that vertue dwelleth in the 
middest, being enuironed with two contrary vices: whereto Morrell replieth 
with continuaunce of the same Philosophers opinion, that albeit all bountye 
dwelleth in mediocritie, yet perfect felicitye dwelleth in supremacie. for they 
say, and most true it is, that happinesse is placed in the highest degree, so as if any 
thing be higher or better, then that streight way ceaseth to be perfect happines. 
Much like to that, which once I heard alleaged in defence of humilitye out of a 
great doctour, <term lang="la">Suorum Christus humillimus</term>: which saying a gentle man in the 
company taking at the rebownd, beate backe again with lyke saying of ano&#173;
ther Doctoure, as he sayde. <term lang="la">Suorum deus allissimus</term>.

ARGVMENT.

IN this &#198;glogue is setforth a delectable controuersie, made in imitation 
of that in Theocritus: whereto also Virgile fashioned his third &#38; seuenth 
&#198;glogue. They choose for vmpere of their strife, Cuddie a neatheards boye, 
who hauing ended their cause, reciteth also himselfe a proper song, whereof 
Colin he sayth was Authour.

<lemeformat>
Willye. Perigot. Cuddie.

TEll me Perigot, what shalbe the game,
Wherefore with myne thou dare thy musick matche?
Or bene thy Bagpypes renne farre out of frame?
Or hath the Crampe thy ioynts benoind with ache?

Perigot.

Ah Willye, when the hart is ill assayde,
How can Bagpipe, or ioynts be well apayd?

Willye.

What the foule euill hath thee so bestadde?
Whilom thou was peregall to the best,
And wont to make the iolly shepeheards gladde
With pyping and dauncing, didst passe the rest.






</page>

<page sig="">
Perigot.

Ah Willye now I haue learnd a newe daunce:
My old musick mard by a newe mischaunce.

Willye.

Mischiefe mought to that newe mischaunce befall,
That so hath raft vs of our meriment.
But reede me, what payne doth thee so appall?
Or louest thou, or bene thy younglings miswent?

Perigot.

Loue hath misled both my younglings, and mee:
I pyne for payne, and they my payne to see,

Willye.

Perdie and wellawaye: ill may they thriue:
Neuer knewe I louers sheepe in good plight.
But and if in rymes with me thou dare striue,
Such fond fantsies shall soone be put to flight.

Perigot.

That shall I doe, though mochell worse I fared:
Neuer shall be sayde that Perigot was dared.

Willye.

Then loe Perigot the Pledge, which I plight:
A mazer ywrought of the Maple warre:
Wherein is enchased many a fayre sight
Of Beres and Tygres, that maken fiers warre:
And ouer them spred a goodly wild vine,
Entrailed with a wanton Yuie twine.

Thereby is a Lambe in the Wolues iawes:
But see, how fast renneth the shepheard swayne,
To saue the innocent from the beastes pawes:
And here with his shepehooke hath him slayne.
Tell me, such a cup hast thou euer sene?
Well mought it beseme any haruest Queene.

Perigot.

Thereto will I pawne yonder spotted Lambe,
Of all my flocke there nis sike another:
For I brought him vp without the Dambe.
But Colin Clout rafte me of his brother,






</page>

<page sig="">
That he purchast of me in the playne field:
Sore against my will was I forst to yield.

Willye.

Sicker make like account of his brother.
But who shall iudge the wager wonne or lost?

Perigot.

That shall yonder heardgrome, and none other,
Which ouer the pousse hetherward doth post.

Willye.

But for the Sunnebeame so sore doth vs beate,
Were not better, to shunne the scortching heate?

Perigot.

Well agreed Willy: then sitte thee downe swayne:
Sike a song neuer heardest thou, but Colin sing.

Cuddie.

Gynne, when ye lyst, ye iolly shepheards twayne:
Sike a iudge, as Cuddie, were for a king.

Perigot.

IT fell vpon a holly eue,

Willye.

    hey ho hollidaye,

Per.

When holly fathers wont to shrieue:

Wil.

    now gynneth this roundelay.

Per.

Sitting vpon a hill so hye,

Wil.

    hey ho the high hyll,

Per.

The while my flocke did feede thereby,

Wil.

    the while the shepheard selfe did spill:

Per.

I saw the bouncing Bellibone,

Wil.

    hey ho Bonibell,

Per.

Tripping ouer the dale alone,

Wil.

    she can trippe it very well:

Per.

Well decked in a frocke of gray,

Wil.

    hey ho gray is greete,

Per.

And in a Kirtle of greene saye,

Wil.

    the greene is for maydens meete:

Per.

A chapelet on her head she wore,

Wil.

    hey ho chapelet,

Per.

Of sweete Violets therein was store,

Wil.

    she sweeter then the Violet.

    Woode as he, that did them keepe.

As the bonilasse passed bye,

Wil.

    hey ho bonilasse,

Per.

She roude at me with glauncing eye,

Wil.

    as cleare as the christall glasse:

Per.

All as the Sunnye beame so bright,

Wil.

    hey ho the Sunne beame,

Per.

Glaunceth from Ph&#339;bus face forthright,

Wil.

    so loue into my hart did streame:

Or as the thonder cleaues the cloudes,

    hey ho the Thonder,

Wherein the lightsome leuin shroudes,

Or as Dame Cynthias siluer raye

    hey ho the Moonelight,

Per.

Vpon the glyttering waue doth playe:

Wil.

    such play is a pitteous plight.

Per.

The glaunce into my heart did glide,

Wil.

    hey ho the glyder,

Per.

Therewith my soule was sharply gryde,

Wil.

    such woundes soone wexen wider.

Per.

Hasting to raunch the arrow out,

Wil.

    hey ho Perigot,

Per.

I left the head in my hart roote:

Wil.

    it was a desperate shot.

Per.

There it ranckleth ay more and more,

Wil.

    hey ho the arrowe,

Per.

Ne can I find salue for my sore:

Wil.

    loue is a carelesse sorrowe.

Per.

And though my bale with death I bought.

Wil.

    hey ho heauie cheere,

But whether in paynefull loue I pyne,

Per.

Or thriue in welth, she shalbe mine.

Wil.

    but if thou can her obteine.

Per.

And if for gracelesse greefe I dye,

Witnesse, shee slewe me with her eye:

For priefe thereof, my death shall weepe,

So learnd I loue on a hollye eue,

Per.

That euer since my hart did greue.

Wil.

    now endeth our roundelay.

Cuddye,

Sicker sike a roundle neuer heard I none.
Little lacketh Perigot of the best.
And Willye is not greatly ouergone,
So weren his vndersongs well addrest.

Willye.

Herdgrome, I feare me, thou haue a squint eye:
Areede vprightly, who has the victorye?

Cuddie.

Fayth of my soule, I deeme ech haue gayned.
For thy let the Lambe be Willye his owne:
And for Perigot so well hath hym payned,
To hin be the wroughten mazer alone.

Perigot.

Perigot is well pleased with the doome:
Ne can Willye wite the witelesse herdgroome.

Willye.

Neuer dempt more right of beautye I weene,
The shepheard of Ida, that iudged beauties Queene.

Cuddie.

But tell me shepherds, should it not yshend
Your roundels fresh, to heare a doolefull verse

<page sig="">
Of Rosalend (who knowes not Rosalend?)
That Colin made, ylke can I you rehearse.

Perigot.

Now say it Cuddie, as thou art a ladde:
With mery thing its good to medle sadde.

Willy.

Fayth of my soule, thou shalt ycrouned be
In Colins stede, if thou this song areede:
For neuer thing on earth so pleaseth me,
As him to heare, or matter of his deede,

Cuddie.

Then listneth ech vnto my heauy laye,
And tune your pypes as ruthful, as ye may.

YE wastefull woodes beare witnesse of my woe,
  Wherein my plaints did oftentimes resound:
  Ye carelesse byrds are priuie to my cryes,
  Which in your songs were wont to make apart:
  Thou pleasaunt spring hast luld me oft a sleepe,
  Whose streames my tricklinge teares did ofte augment.
Resort of people doth my greefs augment,
  The walled townes do worke my greater woe:
  The forest wide is fitter to resound
  The hollow Echo of my carefull cryes,
  I hate the house, since thence my loue did part,
  Whose wayle full want debarres myne eyes from sleepe
Let stremes of teares supply the place of sleepe:
  Let all that sweete is, voyd: and all that may augment
  My doole, drawe neare. More meete to wayle my woe,
  Bene the wild woddes my sorrowes to resound,
  Then bedde, or bowre, both which I fill with cryes,
  When I them see so waist, and fynd no part
Of pleasure past. Here will I dwell apart
  In gastfull groue therefore, till my last sleepe
  Doe close mine eyes: so shall I not augment
  With sight of such a chaunge my restlesse woe:
  Helpe me, ye banefull byrds, whose shrieking sound
  Ys signe of dreery death, my deadly cryes






</page>

<page sig="">
Most ruthfully to tune. And as my cryes
  (Which of my woe cannot bewray least part)
  You heare all night, when nature craueth sleepe,
  Increase, so let your yrksome yells augment.
  Thus all the night in plaints, the daye in woe
  I vowed haue to wayst, till safe and sound
She home returne, whose voyces siluer sound
  To cheerefull songs can chaunge my cherelesse cryes.
  Hence with the Nightingale will I take part,
  That blessed byrd, that spends her time of sleepe
  In songs and plaintiue pleas, the more taugment
  The memory of hys misdeede, that bred her woe:
And you that feele no woe, when as the sound
  Of these my nightly cryes ye heare apart,
  Let breake your sounder sleepe and pitie augment.

Perigot.

O Colin, Colin, the shepheards ioye,
  How I admire ech turning of thy verse:
And Cuddie, fresh Cuddie the liefest boye,
  How dolefully his doole thou didst rehearse.

Cuddie.

Then blowe your pypes shepheards, til you be at home:
The night nigheth fast, yts time to be gone.

ARGVMENT.

HErein Diggon Dauie is deuised to be a shepheard, that in hope of more 
gayne, droue his sheepe into a farre countrye. The abuses whereof, and 
loose liuing of Popish prelates, by occasion of Hobbinols dema<expan type="">un</expan>d, he discour&#173;
seth at large.

<lemeformat>
Hobbinol.   Diggon Dauie.

DIggon Dauie, I bidde her god day:
Or Diggon her is, or I missaye.

Diggon.

Her was her, while it was daye light,
But now her is a most wretched wight.
For day, that was, is wightly past,
And now at earst the dirke night doth hast.

Hobbinoll.

Diggon areede, who has thee so dight?
Neuer I wist thee in so poore a plight.
Where is the fayre flocke, thou was wont to leade?
Or bene they chaffred? or at mischiefe dead?






</page>

<page sig="">
Diggon.

Ah for loue of that, is to thee moste leefe,
Hobbinol, I pray thee gall not my old griefe:
Sike question ripeth vp cause of newe woe,
For one opened mote vnfolde many moe.

Hobbinoll.

Nay, but sorrow close shrouded in hart
I know, to kepe, is a burdenous smart.
Eche thing imparted is more eath to beare:
When the rayne is faln, the cloudes wexen cleare.
And nowe sithence I sawe thy head last,
Thrise three Moones bene fully spent and past:
Since when thou hast measured much grownd,
And wandred I wene about the world rounde,
So as thou can many thinges relate:
But tell me first of thy flocks astate.

Diggon.

My sheepe bene wasted, (wae is me therefore)
The iolly shepheard that was of yore,
Is nowe nor iollye, nor shepehearde more.
In forrein costes, men sayd, was plentye:
And so there is, but all of miserye.
I dempt there much to haue eeked my store,
But such eeking hath made my hartsore.
In tho countryes, whereas I haue bene,
No being for those, that truely mene,
But for such, as of guile maken gayne,
No such countrye, as there to remaine.
They setten to sale their shops of shame,
And maken a Mart of theyr good name.
The shepheards there robben one another,
And layen baytes to beguile her brother.
Or they will buy his sheepe out of the cote,
Or they will caruen the shepheards throte.
The shepheards swayne you cannot wel ken,
But it be by his pryde, from other men:
They looken bigge as Bulls, that bene bate,






</page>

<page sig="">
And bearen the cragge so stiffe and so state,
As cocke on his dunghill, crowing cranck.

Hobbinoll.

Diggon, I am so stiffe, and so stanck,
That vneth may I stand any more:
And nowe the Westerne wind bloweth sore,
That nowe is in his chiefe souereigntee,
Beating the withered leafe from the tree.
Sitte we downe here vnder the hill:
Tho may we talke, and tellen our flll,
And make a mocke at the blustring blast.
Now say on Diggon, what euer thou hast.

Diggon.

Hobbin, ah hobbin, I curse the stounde,
That euer I cast to haue lorne this grounde.
Wel-away the while I was so fonde,
To leaue the good, that I had in hande,
In hope of better, that was vncouth:
So lost the Dogge the flesh in his mouth.
My seely sheepe (ah seely sheepe)
That here by there I whilome vsd to keepe,
All were they lustye, as thou didst see,
Bene all sterued with pyne and penuree.
Hardly my selfe escaped thilke payne,
Driuen for neede to come home agayne.

Hobbinoll,

Ah fon, now by thy losse art taught,
That seeldome chaunge the better brought.
Content who liues with tryed state,
Neede feare no chaunge of frowning fate:
But who will seeke for vnknowne gayne,
Oft liues by losse, and leaues with payne.

Diggon.

I wote ne Hobbin how I was bewitcht
With vayne desyre, and hope to be enricht.
But sicker so it is, as the bright starre
Seemeth ay greater, when it is farre:






</page>

<page sig="">
I thought the soyle would haue made me rich:
But nowe I wote, it is nothing sich.
For eyther the shepeheards bene ydle and still,
And ledde of theyr sheepe, what way they wyll:
Or they bene false, and full of couetise,
And casten to compasse many wrong emprise.
But the more bene fraight with fraud and spight,
Ne in good nor goodnes taken delight:
But kindle coales of contech and yre,
Wherewith they sette all the world on fire:
Which when they thinken agayne to quench
With holy water, they doen hem all drench.
They saye they con to heauen the high way,
But by my soule I dare vndersaye,
They neuer sette foote in that same troade,
But balk the right way, and strayen abroad.
They boast they han the deuill at commaund:
But aske hem therefore, what they han paund.
Marrie that great Pan bought with deare borrow,
To quite it from the blacke bowre of sorrowe.
But they han sold thilk same long agoe:
For thy woulden drawe with hem many moe.
But let hem gange alone a Gods name:
As they han brewed, so let hem beare blame.

Hobbinoll.

Diggon, I praye thee speake not so dirke.
Such myster saying me seemeth to mirke.

Diggon.

Then playnely to speake of shepheards most what,
Badde is the best (this english is flatt.)
Their ill hauiour garres men missay,
Both of their doctrine, and of their faye.
They sayne the world is much war then it wont,
All for her shepheards bene beastly and blont.
Other sayne, but how truely I note,
All for they holden shame of theyr cote.

That sike mischiefe graseth hem emong,
All for they casten too much of worlds care,
To deck her Dame, and enrich her heyre:
For such encheason, If you goe nye,
Fewe chymneis reeking you shall espye:
The fatte Oxe, that wont ligge in the stal,
Is nowe fast stalled in her crumenall.
Thus chatten the people in theyr steads,
Ylike as a Monster of many heads.
But they that shooten neerest the pricke,
Sayne, other the fat from their beards doen lick.
For bigge Bulles of Basan brace hem about,
That with theyr hornes butten the more stoute:
But the leane soules treaden vnder foote.
And to seeke redresse mought little boote:
For liker bene they to pluck away more,
Then ought of the gotten good to restore.
For they bene like foule wagmoires ouergrast,
That if thy galage once sticketh fast,
The more to wind it out thon doest swinck,
Thou mought ay deeper and deeper sinck.
Yet better leaue of with a little losse,
Then by much wrestling to leese the grosse.

Hobbinoll.

Nowe Diggon, I see thou speakest to plaine:
Better it were, a little to feyne,
And cleanly couer, that cannot be cured.
Such il, as is forced, mought nedes be endured
But of sike pastoures howe done the flocks creepe?

Diggon.

Sike as the shepheards, sike bene her sheepe,
For they nill listen to the shepheards voyce,
But if he call hem at theyr good choyce,
They wander at wil, and stray at pleasure,
And to theyr foldes yeeld at their owne leasure.
But they had be better come at their cal:
For many han into mischiefe fall,

And bene of rauenous Wolues yrent,
All for they nould be buxome and bent.

Hobbinoll.

Fye on thee Diggon, and all thy foule leasing,
Well is knowne that sith the Saxon king,
Neuer was Woolfe seene many nor some,
Nor in all Kent, nor in Chrisiendome:
But the fewer Woolues (the soth to sayne,)
The more bene the Foxes that here remaine.

Diggon.

Yes, but they gang in more secrete wise,
And with sheepes clothing doen hem disguise,
They walke not widely as they were wont
For feare of raungers, and the great hunt:
But priuely prolling two and froe,
Enaunter they mought be inly knowe.

Hobbinol.

Or priue or pert yf any bene,
We han great Bandogs will teare their skinne.

Diggon.

Indeede thy ball is a bold bigge curre,
And could make a iolly hole in thoyr furre.
But not good Dogges hem needeth to chace,
But heedy shepheards to difcerne their face.
For all their craft is in their countenaunce,
The bene so graue and full of mayntenaunce.
But shall I tell thee what my selfe knowe,
Chaunced to Roffynn not long ygoe?

Hobbinol.

Say it out Diggon, what euer it hight,
For not but well mought him betight.
He is so meeke, wise, and merciable,
And with his word his worke is conuenable.
Colin clout I wene be his selfe boye,
(Ah for Colin he whilome my ioye)
Shepheards sich, God mought vs many send,
That doen so carefully theyr flocks tend.

<page sig="">
Diggon.

Thilk same shepheard mought I well marke:
He has a Dogge to byte or to barke,
Neuer had shepheard so kene a kurre,
That waketh, and if but a lease sturre.
Whilome there wonned a wicked Wolfe,
That with many a Lambe had glutted his gulfe.
And euer at night wont to repayre
Vnto the flocke, when the Welkin shone faire,
Ycladde in clothing of seely sheepe,
When the good old man vsed to sleepe.
Tho at midnight he would barke and ball,
(For he had eft learned a curres call.)
As if a Woolfe were emong the sheepe.
With that the shepheard would breake his sleepe,
And send out Lowder (for so his dog hote)
To raunge the fields with wide open throte.
Tho when as Lowder was farre awaye.
This Woluish sheepe would catchen his pray,
A Lambe, or a Kidde, or a weanell wast:
With that to the wood would he speede him fast.
Long time he vsed this slippery pranck,
Ere Roffy could for his laboure him thanck
At end the shepheard his practise spyed,
(For Roffy is wise, and as Argus eyed)
And when at euen he came to the flocke,
Fast in theyr folds he did them locke,
And tooke out the Woolfe in his counterfect cote,
And let out the sheepes bloud at his throte.

Diggon.

Marry Diggon, what should him affraye,
To take his owne where euer it laye?
For had his wesand bene a little widder,
He would haue deuoured both hidder &#38; shidder.

Diggon.

Mischiese light on him, and Gods great curse,
Too good for him had bene a great deale worse:






</page>

<page sig="">
For it was a perilous beast aboue all,
And eke had he cond the shepherds call.
And oft in the night came to the shepecote,
And called Lowder, with a hollow throte,
As if it the old man selfe had bene.
The dog his maisters voice did it weene,
Yet halfe in doubt, he opened the dore,
And ranne out, as he was wont of yore.
No sooner was out, but swifter then thought,
Fast by the hyde the Wolfe lowder caught:
And had not Roffy renne to the steuen,
Lowder had be slaine thilke same euen.

Hobbinoll.

God shield man, he should so ill haue thriue,
All for he did his deuoyr beliue.
If sike vene Wolues, as thou hast told,
How mought we Diggon, hem be-hold.

Diggon.

How, but with heede and watchfulnesse,
For stallen hem of their wilinesse?
For thy with shepheard sittes not playe,
Or sleepe, as some doen, all the long day:
But euer liggen in watch and ward,
From soddein force theyr flocks for to gard.

Hobbinoll.

Ah Diggon, thilke same rule were too straight,
All the cold season to wach and waite.
We bene of fleshe, men as other bee.
Why should we be bound to such miseree?
What euer thing lacketh chaungeable rest,
Mought needes decay, when it is at best.

Diggon.

Ah but Hobbinol, all this long tale,
Nought easeth the care, that doth me forhaile.
What shall I doe? what way shall I wend,
My piteous plight and losse to amend?
Ah good Hobbinol, mought I thee praye,
Of ayde or counsell in my decaye.

<page sig="">
Hobbinoll.

Now by my soule Diggon, I lament
The haplesse mischief, that has thee hent,
Nethelesse thou seest my lowly saile,
That froward fortune doth euer auaile.
But were Hobbinoll, as God mought please,
Diggon should soone find fauour and ease.
But if to my cotage thou wilt resort,
So as I can: I wil thee comfort:
There mayst thou ligge in a vetchy bed,
Till fayrer Fortune shewe forth his head.

Diggon.

Ah Hobbinol, God mought it thee requite.
Diggon on fewe such freends did euer lite.

<lemeformat>
    Pierce.   Cuddie.

CVddie, for shame hold vp thy heauye head,
And let vs cast with what delight to chace:






</page>

<page sig="">
And weary thys long lingring Ph&#339;bus race.
Whilome thou wont the shepheards laddes to leade,
In rymes, in ridles, and in bydding base:
Now they in thee, and thou in sleepe art dead?

Cuddye.

Piers, I haue pyped erst so long with payne,
That all mine Oten reedes bene rent and wore:
And my poore Muse hath spent her spared store,
Yet little good hath got, and much lesse gavne.
Such pleasaunce makes the Grashopper so poore,
And ligge so layd, when Winter doth her straine:

The dapper ditties, that I wont deuise,
To feede youthes fancie, and the flocking fry,
Delighten much: what I the bett for thy?
They han the pleasure, I a sclender prise.
I beate the bush, the byrds to them doe flye:
What good there of to Cuddie can arise?

Pires.

Cuddie, the prayse is better, then the price,
The glory eke much greater then the gayne:
O what an honor is it, to restraine
The lust of lawlesse youth with good aduice:
Or pricke them forth with pleasaunce of thy vaine,
Whereto thou list their trayned willes entice.

Soone as thou gynst to sette thy notes in frame,
O how the rurall routes to thee doe cleaue:
Seemeth thou dost their soule of sence bereaue,
All as the shepheard, that did fetch his dame
From Plutoes balefull bowre withouten leaue:
His musicks might the hellish hound did tame.

Cuddie.

So praysen babes the Peacoks spotted traine,
And wondren at bright Argus blazing eye:
But who rewards him ere the more for thy?
Or feedes him once the fuller by a graine?






</page>

<page sig="">
Sike prayse is smoke, that sheddeth in the skye,
Sike words bene wynd, and wasten soone in vayne.

Piers.

Abandon then the base and viler clowne,
Lyft vp thy selfe out of the lowly dust:
And sing of bloody Mars, of wars, of giusts,
Turne thee to those, that weld the awful crowne.
To doubted Knights, whose woundlesse armour rusts,
And helmes vnbruzed wexen dayly browne.

There may thy Muse display her fluttryng wing,
And stretch her selfe at large from East to West:
Whither thou list in fayre Elisa rest,
Or if thee please in bigger notes to sing,
Aduaunce the worthy whome shee loueth best,
That first the white beare to the stake did bring.

And when the stubborne stroke of stronger stounds,
Has somewhat slackt the tenor of thy string:
Of loue and lustihead tho mayst thou sing,
And carrol lowde, and leade the Myllers rownde,
All were Elisa one of thilke same ring.
So mought our Cuddies name to Heauen fownde.

Cuddye.

Indeede the Romish Tityrus, I heare,
Through his Mec&#339;nas left his Oaten reede,
Whereon he earst had taught his flocks to feede,
And laboured lands to yield the timely eare,
And eft did sing of warres and deadly drede,
So as the Heauens did quake his verse to here.

But ah Mec&#339;nas is yclad in claye,
And great Augustus long ygoe is dead:
And all the worthies liggen wrapt in leade,
That matter made for Poets on to play:
For euer, who in derring doe were dreade,
The loftie verse of hem was loued aye.






</page>

<page sig="">
But after vertue gan for age to stoupe,
And mighty manhode brought a bedde of ease:
The vaunting Poets found nought worth a pease,
To put in preace emong the learned troupe.
Tho gan the streames of flowing wittes to cease,
And sonnebright honour pend in shamefull coupe.

And if that any buddes of Poesie,
Yet of the old stocke gan to shoote agayne:
Or it mens follies mote be forst to fayne,
And rolle with rest in rymes of rybaudrye.
Or as it sprong, it wither must agayne:
Tom Piper makes vs better melodie.

Piers.

O pierlesse Poesye, where is then the place?
If nor in Princes pallace thou doe sitt:
(And yet is Princes pallace the most fitt)
Ne brest of baser birth doth thee embrace.
Then make thee winges of thine aspyring wit,
And, whence thou camst, flye backe to heauen apace.

Cuddie.

Ah Percy it is all to weake and wanne,
So high to sore, and make so large a flight:
Her peeced pyneons bene not so in plight,
For Colin fittes such famous flight to scanne:
He, were he not with loue so ill bedight,
Would mount as high, and sing as soote as Swanne.

Pires

Ah fon, for loue does teach him climbe so hie,
And lyftes him vp out of the loathsome myre:
Such immortall mirrhor, as he doth admire,
Would rayse ones mynd aboue the starry skie.
And cause a caytiue corage to aspire,
For lofty loue doth loath a lowly eye.

All otherwise the state of Poet stands,
For lordly loue is such a Tyranne fell:
That where he rules, all power he doth expell.

Who euer casts to compasse weightye prise,
And thinks to throwe out thondring words of threate:
Let powre in lauish cups and thriftie bitts of meate,
For Bacchus fruite is frend to Ph&#339;bus wise.
And when with Wine the braine begins to sweate,
The nombers flowe as fast as spring doth ryse.

Thou kenst not Percie howe the ryme should rage.
O if my temples were distaind with wine,
And girt in girlonds of wild Yuie twine,
How I could reare the Muse on stately stage,
And teache her tread aloft in bus-kin fine,
With queint Bellona in her equipage.

But ah my corage cooles ere it be warme,
For thy, content vs in thys humble shade:
Where no such troublous tydes han vs assayde,
Here we our slender pipes may safely charme.

is the power to make men immortal for theyr good dedes, or shameful for their

certaine harmonie and musicall nombers, for the great compassion &#38; likenes of 
affection in thone and in the other as also by that memorable history of Alex&#173;
ander: to whom when as Timotheus the great Musitian playd the Phrygian 
melodie, it is said, that he was distraught with such vnwonted fury, that streight 
way rysing from the table in great rage, he caused himselfe to be armed, as rea&#173;
dy to goe to warre (for that musick is very war like:) And immediatly when&#173;
as the Musitian chaunged his stroke into the Lydian and Ionique harmony, he 
was so furr from warring, that he sat as styl, as if he had bene in matters of coun&#173;
sell. Such might is in musick: wherefore Plato and Aristotle forbid the Aradian 
Melodie from children and youth. For that being altog<emend err="i">e</emend>ther on the fyft and vij. 
tone, it is of great force to mollifie and quench the kindly courage, which vseth 
to burne in yong brests. So that it is not incredible which the Poete here sayth,

aduantage, which he had of Hector. And also that Alexander the great c<expan type="">om</expan>ming

And that such account hath bene alwayes made of Poetes, aswell sheweth this 
that the worthy Scipio in all his warres against Carthage and Numantia had 
euermore in his company, and that in a most familiar sort the good olde Poet 
Ennius: as also that Alexander destroying Thebes, when he was enformed that 
the famous Lyrick Poet Pindarus was borne in that citie, not onely commaun&#173;
ded streightly, that no man should vpon payne of death do any violence to that 
house by fire or otherwise: but also specially spared most, and some highly rewar<emend err="">&#173;</emend>

prayse otherwise was in the same man no lesse famous, that when he came to 
ransacking of king Darius coffers, whom he lately had ouerthrowen, he founde 
in a little coffer of siluer the two bookes of Homers works, as layd vp there for 
speciall iewells and richesse, which he taking thence, put one of them dayly in

IN this xi. &#198;glogue he bewayleth the death of some mayden of greate 
bloud, whom he calleth Dido. The personage is secrete, and to me alto&#173;
gether vnknowne, albe of him selfe I often required the same. This &#198;glo&#173;

of Loys the frenche Queene. But farre passing his reache, and in myne opi&#173;

       Thenot. Colin.

COlin my deare, when shall it please thee sing,
As thou were wont songs of some iouisaunce?
Thy Muse to long slombreth in sorrowing,
Lulled a sleepe through loues misgouernaunce,






</page>

<page sig="">
Now somewhat sing, whose endles souenaunce,
Emong the shepeheards swaines may aye remaine,
Whether thee list thy loued lasse aduaunce,
Or honor Pan with hymnes of higher vaine.

Colin.

Thenot, now nis the time of merimake.
Nor Pan to herye, nor with loue to playe:
Sike myrth in May is meetest for to make,
Or summer shade vnder the cocked haye.
But nowe sadde Winter welked hath the day,
And Ph&#339;bus weary of his yerely tas-ke:
Ystabled hath his steedes in lowlye laye,
And taken vp his ynne in Fishes has-ke.
Thilke sollein season sadder plight doth aske:
And loatheth sike delightes, as thou doest prayse:
The mornefull Muse in myrth now list ne mas-ke,
As shee was wont in youngth and sommer dayes.
But if thou algate lust light virelayes,
And looser songs of loue to vndersong
Who but thy selfe deserues sike Poetes prayse?
Relieue thy Oaten pypes, that sleepen long.

Thenot.

The Nightingale is souereigne of song,
Before him sits the Titmose silent bee:
And I vnfitte to thrust in skilfull thronge,
Should Colin make iudge of my fooleree.
Nay, better learne of hem, that learned bee,
And han be watered at the Muses well:
The kindlye dewedrops from the higher tree,
And wets the little plants that lowly dwell.
But if sadde winters wrathe and season chill,
Accorde not with thy Muses meriment:
To sadder times thou mayst attune thy quill,
And sing of sorrowe and deathes dreeriment.
For deade is Dido, dead alas and drent,
Dido the greate shepehearde his daughter sheene:






</page>

<page sig="">
The fayrest May she was that euer went,
Her like shee has not left behinde I weene.
And if thou wilt bewayle my wofull tene:
I shall thee giue yond Cosset for thy payne:
And if thy rymes as rownd and rufull bene,
As those that did thy Rosalind complayne,
Much greater gyfts for guerdon thou shalt gayne,
Then Kidde or Cosset, which I thee bynempt:
Then vp I say, thou iolly shepeheard swayne,
Let not my small demaund be so contempt.

Colin.

Thenot to that I choose, thou doest me tempt,
But ah to well I wote my humble vaine,
And howe my rymes bene rugged and vnkempt:
Yet as I conne, my conning I will strayne.

VP then Melpomene thou mournefulst Muse of nyne,
Such cause of mourning neuer hadst afore:
Vp grieslie ghostes and vp my rufull ryme,
Matter of myrth now shalt thou haue no more.
For dead shee is, that myrth thee made of yore.
  Dido my deare alas is dead,
  Dead and lyeth wrapt in lead:
    O heauie herse,
Let streaming teares be poured out in store:
    O carefull verse.

Shepheards, that by your flocks on Kentish downes abyde,
Waile ye this wofull waste of natures warke:
Waile we the wight, whose presence was our pryde:
Waile we the wight, whose absence is our carke.
The sonne of all the world is dimme and darke:
  The earth now lacks her wonted light,
  And all we dwell in deadly night,
    O heauie herse.
Breake we our pypes, that shrild as lowde as Larke,
    O carefull verse.

<page sig="">
Why doe we longer liue, (ah why liue we so long)
Whose better dayes death hath shut vp in woe?
The fayrest floure our gyrlond all emong,
Is faded quite and into dust ygoe.
Sing now ye shepheards daughters, sing no moe
The songs that Colin made in her prayse,
But into weeping turne your wanton layes,
O heauie herse,
Now is time to dye. Nay time was long ygoe,
O carefull verse.

Whence is it, that the flouret of the field doth fade,
And lyeth buryed long in Winters bale:
Yet soone as spring his mantle doth displaye,
It floureth fresh, as it should neuer fayle?
But thing on earth that is of most availe,
As vertues braunch and beauties budde.
Reliuen not for any good.
O heauie herse,
The braunch once dead, the budde eke needes must quaile,
O carefull verse.

She while she was, (that was, a woful word to sayne)
For beauties prayse and plesaunce had no pere:
So well she couth the shepherds entertayne,
With cakes and cracknells and such country chere.
Ne would she scorne the simple shepheards swaine,
For she would cal hem often heme
And giue hem curds and clouted Creame.
O heauie herse,
Als Colin cloute she would not once disdayne.
O carefull verse.

But nowe sike happy cheere is turnd to heauie chaunce,
Such pleasaunce now displast by dolors dint:
All Musick sleepes, where death doth leade the daunce,
And shepherds wonted solace is extinct.
The blew in black, the greene in gray is tinct,

  The gaudie girlonds deck her graue,
  The faded flowres her corse embraue.
    O heauie herse,
Morne nowe my Muse, now morne with teares besprint.
    O carefull verse.

O thou greate shepheard Lobbin, how great is thy griefe,
Where bene the nosegayes that she dight for thee:
The colourd chaplets wrought with a chiefe,
The knotted rushrings, and gilte Rosemaree?
For shee deemed nothing too deere for thee.
  Ah they bene all yclad in clay,
  One bitter blast blewe all away.
    O heauie herse,
Thereof nought remaynes but the memoree.
    O carefull verse.

Ay me that dreerie death should strike so mortall stroke,
That can vndoe Dame natures kindly course:
The faded lockes fall from the loftie oke,
The flouds do gaspe, for dryed is theyr sourse,
And flouds of teares flowe in theyr stead perforse.
  The mantled medowes morune,
  Theyr sondry colours torune.
    O heauie herse,
The heauens doe melt in teares without remorse.
    O carsefull verse.

The feeble flocks in field refuse their former foode,
And hang theyr heads, as they would learne to weepe:
The beastes in forest wayle as they were woode,
Except the Wolues, that chase the wandring sheepe:
Now she is gon that safely did hem keepe,
  The Turtle on the bared braunch,
  Laments the wound, that death did launch.

Now bringen bitter Eldre braunches seare,
  The fatall sisters eke repent,

Of mortal men, that swincke and sweate for nought,
And shooting wide, doe misse the marked scope:
Now haue I learnd (a lesson derely bought)
That nys on earth assuraunce to be sought:
  For what might be in earthlie mould,

But maugre death, and dreaded sisters deadly spight,
And gates of hel, and fyrie furies forse:
She hath the bonds broke of eternall night,
Her soule vnbodied of the burdenous corpse.

Vnwise and wretched men to weete whats good or ill,
We deeme of Death as doome of ill desert:
But knewe we fooles, what it vs bringes vntil,
Dye would we dayly, once it to expert.
No daunger there the shepheard can astert:

Dido is gone afore (whose turne shall be the next?)
There liues shee with the blessed Gods in blisse,
There drincks she Nectar with Ambrosia mixt,
And ioyes enioyes, that mortall men doe misse.
The honor now of highest gods she is,
  That whilome was poore shepheards pryde,
  While here on earth she did abyde.
    O happy herse,
Ceasse now my song, my woe now wasted is.

With doolful pleasaunce, so as I ne wotte,

Vp Colin vp, ynough thou morned hast,
Now gynnes to mizzle, hye we homeward fast.

Which is as much to say, as death biteth not. For although by course of nature we be 
borne to dye, and being ripened with age, as with a timely haruest, we must be 
gathered in time, or els of our selues we fall like rotted ripe fruite fro the tree: 
yet death is not to be counted for euil, nor (as the Poete sayd a little before) as 
doome of ill desert) For though the trespasse of the first man brought death in 
to the world, as the guerdon of sinne, yet being ouercome by the death of one, 
that dyed for al, it is now made (as Chaucer sayth) the grene path way to lyfe. 
So that it agreeth well with that was sayd, that Death byteth not (that is) hur&#173;
teth not at all.

ARGVMENT.

THis &#198;glogue (euen as the first beganne) is ended with a complaynte 
of Colin to God Pan. wherein as weary of his former wayes, he pro&#173;
portioneth his life to the foure seasons of the yeare, comparing hys youthe 
to the spring time, when he was fresh and free from loues follye. His man&#173;
hoode to the sommer, which he sayth, was consumed with greate heate and 
excessiue drouth caused throughe a Comet or blasinge starre, by which hee 
meaneth loue, which passion is comenly compared to such flames and immo&#173;
derate heate. His riper yeares hee resembleth to an vnseasonable harueste 
wherein the fruites fall ere they be rype. His latter age to winters chyll &#38; 
frostie season, now drawing neare to his last ende.

<lemeformat>
THe gentle shepheard satte beside a springe,
All in the shadowe of a bushye brere,
That Colin hight, which wel could pype and singe,
For he of Tityrus his songs did lere.
  There as he satte in secreate shade alone,
  Thus gan he make of loue his piteous mone.

<page sig="">
O soueraigne Pan thou God of shepheards all,
Which of our tender Lambkins takest keepe:
And when our flocks into mischaunce mought fall,
Doest saue from mischiefe the vnwary sheepe:
  Als of their maisters hast no lesse regarde,
  Then of the flocks, which thou doest watch and ward:

I thee beseche (so be thou deigne to heare,
Rude ditties tund to shepheards Oaten reede,
Or if I euer sonet song so cleare,
As it with pleasaunce mought thy fancie feede)
  Hearken awhile from thy greene cabinet,
  The rurall song of carefull Colinet.

Whilome in youth, when flowrd my ioyfull spring,
Like Swallow swift I wandred here and there:
For heate of heedlesse lust me so did sting,
That I of doubted daunger had no feare.
  I went the wastefull woodes and forest wyde,
  Withouten dreade of Wolues to bene espyed,

I wont to raunge amydde the mazie thickette,
And gather nuttes to make me Christmas gaine:
And ioyed oft to chace the trembling Pricket,
Or hunt the hartlesse hare, til shee were tame.
  What wreaked I of wintrye ages waste,
  Tho deemed I, my spring would euer laste.

How often haue I scaled the craggie Oke,
All to dislodge the Rauen of her neste:
Howe haue I wearied with many a stroke,
The stately Walnut tree, the while the rest
  Vnder the tree fell all for nuts at strife:
  For ylike to me was libertee and lyfe.

And for I was in thilke same looser yeares,
(Whether the Muse, so wrought me from my birth,
Or I tomuch beleeued my shepherd peres)
Somedele ybent to song and musicks mirth.






</page>

<page sig="">
  A good olde shephearde, Wrenock was his name,
  Made me by arte more cunning in the same.

Fro thence I durst in derring to compare
With shepheards swayne, what euer fedde in field:
And if that Hobbinol right iudgement bare,
To Pan his owne selfe pype I neede not yield.
  For if the flocking Nymphes did folow Pan.
  The wiser Muses after Colin ranne.

But ah such pryde at length was ill repayde,
The shepheards God (perdie God was he none)
My hurtlesse pleasaunce did me ill vpbraide,
My freedome lorne, my life he lefte to mone.
  Loue they him called, that gaue me checkmate,
  But better mought they haue behote him Hate.

Tho gan my louely Spring bid me farewel,
And Sommer season sped him to display
(For loue then in the Lyons house did dwell)
The raging fyre, that kindled at his ray.
  A comett stird vp that vnkindly heate,
  that reigned (as men sayd) in Venus seate.

Forth was I ledde, not as I wont afore,
When choise I had to choose my wandring waye:
But whether luck and loues vnbridled lore
Would leade me forth on Fancies bitte to playe.
  The bush my bedde, the bramble was my bowre,
  The Woodes can witnesse many a wofull stowre.

Where I was wont to seeke the honey Bee,
Working her formall rowines in Wexen frame:
The grieslie Todestoole growne there mought I se
And loathed Paddocks lording on the same.
  And where the chaunting birds luld me a sleepe,
  The ghastlie Owle her grieuous ynne doth keepe.






</page>

<page sig="">
Then as the springe giues place to elder time,
And bringeth forth the fruite of sommers pryde:
Also my age now passed youngthly pryme,
To thinges of ryper reason selfe applyed.
  And learnd of lighter timber cotes to frame,
  Such as might saue my sheepe and me fro shame.

To make fine cages for the Nightingale,
And Bas-kets of bulrushes was my wont:
Who to entrappe the fish in winding sale
Was better seene, or hurtful beastes to hont?
  I learned als the signes of heauen to ken,
  How Ph&#339;be fayles, where Venus sittes and when.

And tryed time yet taught me greater thinges,
The sodain rysing of the raging seas:
The soothe of byrds by beating of their wings,
The power of herbs, both which can hurt and ease:
  And which be wont tenrage the restlesse sheepe,
  And which be wont to worke eternall sleepe.

But ah vnwise and witlesse Colin cloute,
That kydst the hidden kinds of many a wede:
Yet kydst not ene to cure thy sore hart roote,
Whose ranckling wound as yet does rifelye bleede.
  Why liuest thou stil, and yet hast thy deathes wound?
  Why dyest thou stil, and yet aliue art founde?

Thus is my sommer worne away and wasted,
Thus is my haruest hastened all to rathe:
The eare that budded faire, is burnt &#38; blasted,
And all my hoped gaine is turnd to scathe.
  Of all the seede, that in my youth was sowne,
  Was nought but brakes and brambles to be mowne.

My boughes with bloosmes that crowned were at firste,
And promised of timely fruite such store,
Are left both bare and barrein now at erst:
The flattring fruite is fallen to grownd before.






</page>

<page sig="">
And rotted, ere they were halfe mellow ripe:
My haruest wast, my hope away dyd wipe.

The fragrant flowres, that in my garden grewe,
Bene withered, as they had bene gathered long.
Theyr rootes bene dryed vp for lacke of dewe,
Yet dewed with teares they han be euer among.
  Ah who has wrought my Rosalind this spight
  To spil the flowres, that should her girlond dight,

And I, that whilome wont to frame my pype,
Vnto the shifting of the shepheards foote:
Sike follies nowe haue gathered as too ripe,
And cast hem out, as rotten and vnsoote.
  The loser Lasse I cast to please nomore,
  One if I please, enough is me therefore.

And thus of all my haruest hope I haue
Nought reaped but a weedye crop of care:
Which, when I thought haue thresht in swelling sheaue,
Cockel for corne, and chaffe for barley bare.
  Soone as the chaffe should in the fan be fynd,
  All was blowne away of the wauering wynd.

So now my yeare drawes to his latter terme,
My spring is spent, my sommer burnt vp quite:
My harueste hasts to stirre vp winter sterne,
And bids him clayme with rigorous rage hys right.
  So nowe he stormes with many a sturdy stoure,
  So now his blustring blast eche coste doth scoure.

The carefull cold hath nypt my rugged rynde,
And in my face deepe furrowes eld hath pight:
My head besprent with hoary frost I fynd,
A<emend err="u">n</emend>d by myne eie the Crow his clawe dooth wright.
  Delight is layd abedde, and pleasure past,
  No sonne now shines, cloudes han all ouer cast.

Now leaue ye shepheards boyes your merry gles,
My Muse is hoarse and weary of thys stounde:






</page>

<page sig="">
Here will I hang my pype vpon this tree,
Was neuer pype of reede did better sounde.
  Winter is come, that blowes the bitter blaste,
  And after Winter commeth death does hast.

Gather ye together my little flocke,
My little flock, that was to me so liefe:
Let me, ah lette me in your folds ye lock,
Ere the breme Winter breede you greater griefe.
  Winter is come, that blowes the balefull breath,
  And after Winter commeth timely death.

Adieu delightes, that lulled me asleepe,
Adieu my deare, whose loue I bought so deare:
Adieu my little Lambes and loued sheepe,
Adieu ye Woodes that oft my witnesse were:
  Adieu good Hobbinol, that was so true,
  Tell Rosalind, her Colin bids her adieu.

Loe I haue made a Calender for euery yeare,
That steele in strength, and time in durance shall out weare:
And if I marked well the starres reuolution,
It shall continewe till the worlds dissolution.
To teach the ruder shepheard how to feede his sheepe.
And from the falsers fraud his folded flocke to keepe.
Goe lyttle Calender, thou hast a free passeporte.
Goe but a lowly gate emongste the meaner sorte.
Dare not to match thy pype with Tityrus hys style,
Nor with the Pilgrim that the Ploughman playde a whyle:
But followe them farre off, and their high steppes adore,
The better please, the worse despise, I aske nomore.
