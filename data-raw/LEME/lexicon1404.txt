"Now the Adit is from the Latine word Aditus, 
that is to say, an entry, passage, or approach to a thing. 
And this is usually made on the side of the Hill, 
but towards the bottom, about 4, 5, or 6 feet high, 
and 8 feet wide, in the nature of an Arch, 
sometimes cut in the rock, and sometimes supported 
with timber; so that the sole or bottom of this Adit 
may answer the bottom of the Shaft, but somewhat lower, 
so as the water may have a sufficient Current to pass away, 
which is exactly known by the ordinary ways of Dialing, 
or the Workmans keeping the water at his foot 
while there is any: and he is directed toward the Shaft 
by a Needle touch'd with a Loadstone, 
the using whereof is called Dialling: and by this and 
other Arts the water is conveyed away with more 
ease and less charge then by Pumps" (p. 2).

"MEtall being thus Coyned or Minted, it is called Coyn 
from Cudere to forge, or from Communis, 
because it is then made common, or from the French word Coigne, 
which signifies a Corner, because most of the Coynes anciently 
were made with Angles, and some at this day in Spain and France.

Or it is more probable, Vorstigan makes King and Cuning Synonyma's, 
so may King, Cuning and Coyning; for his Regality is shewn by his Coyn, 
and to know the intrinsick value, use and allays fit for Coyn, 
shews his Cunning; for we use that word to express a subtilty, 
or exquisite knowledge of any Art or Science.

But the Romans had three names for Coyn; Pecunia 
from Pecora, Cattel; because men who abounded in Cattel 
were accounted rich, and call'd Pecuarii; and now those 
who abound in Coyn are called Pecuniosi; The other name 
they gave was Nummus from King Numa as 'tis conjectured, 
who first gave an Impression on them; or from Numero, 
and therefore when money was paid, they say, and so we in our Law, 
it was paid Pecuniis numeratis" P. 42).
