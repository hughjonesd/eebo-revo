I Doubt not but 
that the title of 
this treatise all

our Englyshe 
eares, wil cause 
some men at the fyrst syghte to 
maruayle what the matter of 
it should meane: yea, and per&#173;
aduenture if they be rashe of 
iudgement, to cal it some newe 
fangle, and so casting it hasti&#173;

safe to reade it: and if they do, 
yet perceiuynge nothing to be

</page>

<page sig="A4v">
And bicause longe ago, I was 
well acquaynted wyth them, 
when I red them to other in <expan type="">the</expan>

muche the more ready to make 
them speak English: partli, to 
renew the pleasure of mine old 
studies, and partelye to satys&#173;

Beside this, I was moued al&#173;
so wyth the authorytye of 
<note type="m">
Rodulphus
Agricola.
</note>
that famous clarke Rodul&#173;

certeine Epistle wrytten vnto 
a frynde of hys, exhorteth m<expan type="">en</expan> 
what soeuer they reade in 
straunge tongues, diligently 
to translate the same into their

in it we sonar perceiue if there

<page sig="A5r">
be any faute in our speaking,

<expan type="">the</expan> learned in it haue written of 
schemes &#38; fygures, which thei 
wold not haue don, except thei 
had perceyued the valewe. 

Wherfore after theyr example 
obtaynyng a lytle lesure, I red 
ouer sundrye treatises, as wel 
of those which wrot long ago, 
as of others now in our daies: 
fyndynge amonge them some

Cicero in hys boke of an ora&#173;

or by theyr ex<expan type="">am</expan>ples. Erasmus 
in hys double copye of words

Wherfore to make these thin&#173;

</page>

<page sig="A6r">
that lyst to reade them in oure 
tongue, I haue taken a lytle 
payne, more thorowelye to try 
the definicions, to apply the ex<emend err="">&#173;</emend>
amples more aptly, &#38; to make 
things defused more plaine, as 
in dede it shal ryght wel apere 
to the dylygente. I haue not 
translated them orderly out of 
anye one author, but runninge 
as I sayde thorowe many, and 
vsyng myne owne iudgement, 
haue broughte them into this 
body as you se, and set them in 
so playne an order, that redelye 
maye be founde the figure, and 
the vse wherevnto it serueth. 
Thoughe vnto greate wittes 
occupyed wyth weightye mat&#173;

<page sig="A6v">
toures, they may be commodi&#173;
ous to helpe them selues for the 
better vnderstandynge of such 
good authors as they reade. 

For thys darre I saye, no elo&#173;
quente wryter maye be percei&#173;
ued as he shulde be wythoute 
the knowledge of them: for as&#173;
muche as al togethers they be&#173;
longe to Eloquucion, whyche 
is the thyrde and pryncipall

readynge, to saye vnto their 
scholers: <term lang="la">Hic est figura</term>: and some&#173;
tyme to axe them, <term lang="la">Per quam figu&#173;

if they go no further? In spea&#173;
kynge and wrytynge nothyng 
is more folyshe than to affecte

darkelye for the nonce, sithe the

greate streame of eloquucion, not 
only must we chose apte, and mete 
wordes, but also take hede of pla&#173;
cinge, and settinge them in order. 
For the myghte and power of elo&#173;
quucion consisteth in wordes con&#173;
sidered by them selues, and when 
they be ioyned together. Apt wor&#173;
des by searchyng muste be founde

To chose th<expan type="">em</expan> oute finely, and hand&#173;

ces, after the mynde of Cicero and 
Quintilian, is no easy thynge. So 
Marcus Antonius was wonte to 
say, that he had knowen many wel

Tullye and Quintilian thoughte 
that inuencion and disposici<expan type="">on</expan> were

Of these thynges that we put in

care, to speake euidentlye after the 
dignitye and nature of thynges, 
and to vtter suche wordes, whych 
as Cicero sayth in hys oratour, no 
man may iustely reprehende. The 
playne and euident speche is lear&#173;
ned of Gramarians, and it kee&#173;
peth the oracion pure, and without

</page>

<page sig="B2v">
thyng may seme to be spoken pure<emend err="">&#173;</emend>

speche standeth by vsuall wordes 
that be in vse of daylye talke, and 
proper wordes that belonge to the 
thinge, of the which we shal speke. 
Neyther be properties to be refer&#173;
red onely to the name of the thing,

By ficcion, eyther in one degree, or

that amplificacion and ornacion 
shuld not be taken out of the same 
places from whence ther commeth 
probacion. Nor it is no newes 
the selfe same thynges to be apply&#173;
ed to diuerse vses. As of all circum&#173;
staunces both of the thyng, and of 
the person are taken argumentes, 
but euen oute of the selfe same are 
fet affeccions and exaggeracions, 
whych is manifest in the kynde de&#173;
monstratiue: As when we prayse

</page>

<page sig="E5v">
aboute to perswade that he was 
chaste, but that that vertue shulde 
appeare greater in floryshyng age. 
To lyke vse serue examples and si&#173;
militudes, as in Esaye: The Oxe 
knewe hys owner, and the Asse the 
maunger of hys master, but Isra&#173;
el hathe not knowen me. The ex&#173;

vsed for this to proue that the He&#173;
brewes dyd not knowe their God, 
but that the impietie and folishnes 
of that nacion shulde be amplified. 
The same may be applied to profe 
after thys maner. If the Oxe and 
Asse knowledge theyr masters, of 
wh<expan type="">om</expan> they are norished and do serue 
them, how much more conueniente 
is it, that m<expan type="">an</expan> shuld knowledge hys

And in this kynd both the whole is 
c<expan type="">om</expan>pared to the whole, &#38; the partes 
to partes: as in the oracion of Ci&#173;

to slaughter, fyer and wastyng, and 
a priuate person to the consuls. 
Ther is an amplificacion also wh<expan type="">en</expan> 
contraries be set together, wherby 
bothe the partes seme bygger, and 
more euidente. As when exhorting

foule a faute couetousenes is, that 
the foulnes of the faute being exag<emend err="">&#173;</emend>
gerate, the goodlines of the vertue 
shulde be more encreased. There is 
another kynd of amplifiyng called 
reasonynge, when of those thinges 
that eyther folowe or go before, the 
hearer doth gather how great that 
thynge is that we wolde to be am&#173;

uerye thinge there be foure causes, 
efficient, materiall, formall and fi&#173;

formes. The forme causeth it to be

because it is a substaunce hathe her 
vnnamed forme, whereby she is a 

<note type="m">

</note>

soule, and not an aungel. And what 
soeuer is made, is made to a certen 
ende, and one thynge maye haue di<emend err="">&#173;</emend>
uerse endes: as nature hathe geuen 
brestes vnto women to geue milke, 
and also for comlynesse of theyr bo&#173;

anye businesse, but for that he desy&#173;
reth to haue some thynge: nor there 
is nothynge desyred, but under the 
consideracion of good or profite. 
So the ende <emend err="why che">whyche</emend> is laste in ef&#173;
fecte, and fyrste in intencion, lo&#173;
keth vpon the gettinge of profites,

<page sig="F2v">
and also vpon them, eschuynge of

Greatly happy shulde men be, if e&#173;

And of such strengthe is the ende, 
that hereof is taken the felicitie of 
euery thyng. To fast that the body 
maye obeye the mynde, to do good 
workes is an holy deede. To fast to

faste to encrease thy good, is coue&#173;

ynge, almose, and other laudable 
workes. After lyke maner must be 
wayed the secondarie endes. An o&#173;

the place, whose qualitie often&#173;
