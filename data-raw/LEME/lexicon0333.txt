for the length of anie Mast is to take 4/5 of 
the breadth of the shipp, and that multiplied 
by 3 shall give the true number of feete that the
Maine Mast shalbe in length. The bignesse to be
one Inch to a yard in length, if it be a Maine 
Mast: For Example take a shipp whose breadth
is 30 foote, fewer Fifths of 30 foote, are 24 foote,
soe as I saie that the shipps Mast Must be 24
yard<expan type="es">es</expan> longe for every yard is 3 foote and 24
inches through alloweinge one inch to every

the Maine Mast <expan type="wch">which</expan> wilbe Twentie yard<expan type="es">es</expan> lacking
one 4/5 part of a yard and 20 inches through 
The Bolt spritt is ever the same In length
