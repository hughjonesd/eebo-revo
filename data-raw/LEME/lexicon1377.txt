Thus have I endeavoured, for the Benefit of the Reader
studious of this Country's Antiquities, to describe most of
the Villages, Towns, and Cities, mentioned in the Testa&#173;
ments of the most pious Sifters. But there are some Places,
in finding out of which my Labour has been fruitless,
either because they lie hid perhaps under new Names, or
are utterly lost, or in a word, because I overlookt them.
It is your Business then, Reader, especially if you are of
Essex, Suffolk, or Ely, to try, whether you can have the
good luck to find the Places, that have either escaped my
Scrutiny, or defeated my Diligence. Here then are their
Names: <term lang="oe">Babbing&#240;yrna. Bir&#230;-tune. Ceafle. Ceorles&#173;
