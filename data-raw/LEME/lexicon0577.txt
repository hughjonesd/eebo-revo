<page sig="a2v">
to send it out with

sooner made that Re&shy;
solution, but present&shy;
ly pitcht on a Patron
under whom to shelter
it. I now humbly de&shy;
dicate it to yourself;
and beg of you to be&shy;

sincerity,

<section To the Reader>
Courteous Reader;
T<f type="i">He ensuing Dictiona&shy;
ry was compil'd in La&shy;
tin, by the eminently
Learned and Famous Phy&shy;
sician, Dr.</f> Stephen Blan&shy;
card, <f type="i">now Physick-Professor
at</f> Middleburgh <f type="i">in</f> Zee&shy;
land; <f type="i">in which he hath taken
that pains, and done it with
such Accurateness, that the
like has never yet been ex&shy;
tant. The Authors he has
consulted (and out of which
he has made the following
Dictionary) you have a Ca&shy;
</page>

<page sig="a3v">
talogue of, ensuing this Pre&shy;
face. But chiefly, and most
of all, he has extracted the
most useful of all the Terms in
Anatomy, Pharmacy, Chi&shy;
rurgery, and Chymistry, out of
ancient Authors, as</f> Eroti&shy;
an, Galen, <f type="i">and others; and
from the more modern, as</f>
Gorr&aelig;us, F&oelig;sius, Castellus,
<f type="i">and others; out of whole Wri&shy;
tings he has not omitted any
one useful term in the whole
art of Physick. I am certain,
that things of this nature are
extremely wanting, that so
the terms (in which all, or the
most part of Mankind has
daily occasion to use) may not</i>
</page>

<page sig="a4r">
<f type="i">be talkt by rote; but may give
a rational account of their
discourse, than which, no&shy;
thing is more rational or de&shy;
monstrative than this of Phy&shy;
sick.

That the Publick-Good
has all along been drove at in
this Affair, both by the Au&shy;
thor and Bookseller, is very
apparent, in that it might
have made a Book of three
times the price, and the mat&shy;
ter spun out to a far great&shy;
er bulk; but in things of this
nature, the Buyer's Interest
ought to be, and has been
consulted.</f>

another part, or to let it out; if it be applyed
without Scarrification, it is called <term lang="la">Cucurbita c&aelig;ca

most fleshy parts, where the large Vessels and
Nerves cannot be hurt. The drawing which is 
performed by these Glasses, is done thus: after the
Skin is scarrified, the Air in the Cupping-glasses is
rarified, and dilated by the flame of the Towe
that is fired within it, which after it is cooled and
condensed, takes up less room than before; so
that the External Air pressing upon the Flesh
without, forces the Blood into the Glass. There
are two sorts of Cupping-glasses, says <f type="i">Celsus</f>, one
of <f type="i">Brass</f>, and the other of <f type="i">Horn</f>; the former is
open on one part, and shut on the other; the lat&shy;
ter is equally open on one part, on the other has
a little hole: burning Towe is thrown into the
Brazen one, and so its mouth is applyed, and
forced upon the Body till it stick. That of Horn,
is applyed singly by it self, and by a violent suck&shy;
ing at the little hole, which must presently be
stopt up close with Wax, it sticks as fast as the
other: but if other things fail, then a little Cup
or Goblet with a strait mouth may be very fitly
applyed to the same Effect; after it has stuck, if
the Skin be scarrified before with a Pen-knife, it
draws out the Blood; if it be whole and entire, it

it differs from it, in that it is more exulcerated,
and is accompanied with speckled Pimples: and
there seem to be in it certain Bubbles, from
which after a certain time there fall, as it were,
little Scales, and it returns more certainly.
Another sort is worse, almost like a sort of 
Meezles, or hot Pimples in the Skin, but more
rugged, and redder, and of different Figures:
In this Distemper little Scales too fall from the
surface of the Skin, and it is called <term lang="la">Rubrica</term>. The
third sort is yet worse, for it is thicker and har&shy;
der, and swells more, and is cleft on the top of
the Skin, and gnaws more violently: It is scaly
too, but black, and spreads broad and slow: It
is called <term lang="la">Nigra</term>. The fourth sort is altogether
incurable, of a different colour from the red;
for it is something white, and like a fresh Scar,
and has pale Scales; some whitish, some like the
little Pulse calld <term lang="la">Lintell</term>, which being taken a&shy;
way, sometimes the Blood follows: Otherwise

the Exterior and upper parts of the Tongue there
are a great many little Bodies which break out
from the Surface of the Tongue, and crooking
moderately incline backwards towards the Root,
so that they look like a Comb that cards Wooll.

About the sides of the Tongue they grow smal&shy;
ler and smaller, so that they almost disappear,
and certain membranous Bodies are placed at
their Basis, which look like a Conical, and then
by and by a more obtuse pappy Substance: All
the little Protuberances are clothed with the
Membrane of the Tongue; they are firmly im&shy;
planted in a certain tenacious Tunic of the
Tongue, there being under them a crass viscous,
or nervous Substance, especially in those places,
where there are remarkable Pits in the Tongue
disposed in like order and manner, so that in
the inner part of the Tongue there are a great
many of them, which are firmly implanted in a 
certain viscous sort of Body. When the Mem&shy;
brane that covers the whole Tongue is taken off
there appears a certain glutinous Substance;
then a nervous pappy Body something yellow,
which spreads like the Membrane, and discovers
remarkable nervous Protuberances disposed of
in a wonderful order. The next thing that ap&shy;
pears are little Nipples in greater abundance
than those spoke of and of another order; for
as many little Protuberances as cover the outside
of the Tongue, so many nervous Nipples of this
sort are found within; these proceed from the
common pappy Substance, grow tolerably high,
and shoot out farther into nervous Sprouts from
the top of them, about which you discover innu&shy;
merable little Protuberances proceeding from 
the same Stock, and of an equal height, only
slenderer, like a Cone, and which go within
