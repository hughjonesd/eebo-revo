<wordentry type="h"><form lang="en">PEstylence</form> <xpln lang="en">is none o&shy;

For euen as pure triacle is a c<expan type="">om</expan>forter

not for any qualitie as is sayde before, 
but for <expan type="">that</expan>, <expan type="">that</expan> his proporti<expan type="">on</expan> is directe eu<expan type="">en</expan>

bodye ful of humours apte to putrefa&shy;
ction, than it doth incontinent assaute 
the lyuelye membres, and excepte re&shy;
medye, brynge the body quycklye to de<emend err="">&shy;</emend>

that it is a poys<expan type="">on</expan> of it selfe in deede, for 
th<emend err="">en</emend> shulde euerye creature be indiffer<expan type="">en</expan>t<emend err="">&shy;</emend>

qualitie that it may be lightlye conuer&shy;

Thus ye maye perceyue that all the
