THis brotherhood of Vacabondes,
To shew that there be such in deede: 
Both Iustices and men of Landes,
Wyll testifye it if it neede. 
For at a Sessions as they sat, 
By chaunce a Vacabond was got.

&#182; Who promysde if they would him spare, 
And keepe his name from knowledge then:
He would as straunge a thing declare,
As euer they knew synce they were men.
But if my fellowes do know (sayd he) 
That thus I dyd, they would kyll me.

&#182; They graunting him this his request, 
He dyd declare as here is read,
Both names and states of most and least, 
Of this their Vacabondes brotherhood. 
Which at the request of a worshipful m<expan type="">an</expan>

much reuerence, and at last like his familier acquain&#173;

which haue come lately from the wars, and as God

to fall a crauing as common Beggers, and as for to 
steale and robbe (God is our record) it striketh vs to

<page sig="a4r">
the hart, to thinke of such a mischiefe, that euer any 
handsome man should fall into such a daunger for thys

craue on such good pityfull men as you seeme to be, nei&#173;
ther yet so daungerously to hasarde our liues for so 
vyle a thing. Therefore good syr, as you seeme to be a 
handsome man your selfe, and also such a one as pitieth 
the miserable case of handsome men, as now your eyes 
and countenaunce sheweth to haue some pity vppon 
this my miserable complainte: So in Gods cause I 
require your maistershyp, &#38; in the behalfe of my poore 
afflicted fellowes, which though here in sight they cry 
not with me to you, yet wheresoeuer they bee, I am 
sure they cry vnto God to moue the heartes of some 
good men to shew forth their liberality in this behalfe. 
All which &#38; I with them craue now the same request 
at your good masterships hand. With these or such like 
words he frameth his talke. Now if the party (which 
he thus talketh withall) profereth hym a peny or .ii. d. 
he taketh it, but verye scornfully, and at last speaketh 
on this sorte: Well syr, your good will is not to be re&#173;
fused. But yet you shall vnderstand (good syr) that this 
is nothing for them, for whom I do thus shamefastly 
entreate. Alas syr, it is not a greate or .xii. d. I speake 
for, being such a company of Seruiters as wee haue 
bene: yet neuertheles God forbid I should not receiue 
your g<expan type="">en</expan>tle offer at this time, hoping hereafter through

shall finde the more liberality. These kind of ydle Va&#173;

Poules, or at Christes Hospital, &#38; somtime at <expan type="">the</expan> Royal

play for thy breakfast with one of vs, that we may haue 
some pastime as we syt? Thys olde Karle makyng it 
straunge at the first saith: My maysters ich am an old 
man, and halfe blinde, and can skyl of very few games, 
yet for that you seeme to be such good Gentelmen, as 
to profer to play for that of which you had no part, but 
onely I my selfe, and therefore of right ich am worthy 
to pay for it, I shal with al my hart fulfyl your request. 
And so falleth to play, somtime at Cardes, &#38; sometime 
at dice. Which through his co<expan type="">un</expan>terfait simplicity in the 
play somtimes ouer counteth himself, or playeth som&#173;
times against his wyl, so as he would not, &#38; then coun<emend err="">&#173;</emend>
terfaiteth to be angry, and falleth to swearing, &#38; so lee&#173;
sing that, profereth to play for a shillyng or two. The 
other therat hauing good sport, seming to mocke him, 
falleth againe to play, and so by their lergerdemane, &#38; 
co<expan type="">un</expan>terfaiting, winneth ech of them a shilling or twain, 
&#38; atlast whispereth the yong man in the eare to play 
with hym also, that ech one might haue a fling at him.

one wyle or other at last conueyeth him selfe away, &#38; 
they as it were raging lyke mad bedlams, one runneth

halfe part, the party that taketh it vp, thinking it to be 
of great value, profereth him some money for his part, 
which he not fully denieth but willeth him to come in&#173;
to some alehouse or tauerne, and there they will com&#173;

him, for he maketh as though he were very desirous 
to haue it. The symple man seeing him so importune 
vpon it, thinketh the ring to bee of great valure, and 
so is the more lother to part from it. At last this ring

lowe me my part, and take you the ring. The other as&#173;

hath not so much ready mony about him, but he wil go 
fetch so much for him, if he wil go with him. The other

maketh the other more fonder of it, and desireth him to

This ring faller seing <expan type="">the</expan> mony, maketh it very stra<expan type="">un</expan>ge,
