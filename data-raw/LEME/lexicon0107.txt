(almost no degrees excepted that in our time it hath not vexed) it
behoueth fyrst to define what an ague is folowing Cicero, which
saith that euery thing which we purpose to speake of must rise of
his definiti<expan type="">on</expan>. an ague </form> <xpln>is anothing els but an vnnatural heate or
caliditie, which taketh his beginninge at the harte, disperseth
all ouer the body by the artiers and veines, and so hurtheth
the actions therof. Thys laste parte of the definition
