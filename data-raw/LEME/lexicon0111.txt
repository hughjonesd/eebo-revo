WHatsoeuer things (sayth 
Cardane) are of Natures 
tempering and dighting, ei&#173;
ther in the earth his closet 
or entrayles, or within the 
water (being all voide of fe&#173;
ling and mouing) may well 
bee deuided and sorted into 
these foure kinds: Earthes 
Liquors or Iuices, Sto&#173;
nes, Mettalles. Earthes, 
saith Diascorides in his fift booke (as also the same 
Author abouesaide) haue their difference eyther in 
colour, in smell, in sauour, or else otherwise in other 
their vse &#38; purposes. Proper or pertinent to earths 
are many &#38; sundrie kindes and sorts, as those which 
either are in house with them, and fare as they 
fare, as Sande, which Isidore nameth the lightest 
earth, as others: or those which are neuer absent
from the earth but are intermedled with the water, 
as Alume, which of some is called the 
earth his salt, as salt it selfe and such like. In earthes are diuers 
dispositions and farre diuers effects (which thing 
Diascorides pursueth aboundantly) there are also 
reckned diuers names of diuers kindes: as that of 
Eretria a famous Citie in the Ile of Eubea, hath 
his sett and disposition of colour and shew ashie like, 
and is in his kinde in operation a sore binder, besides 
this marueilously colde. And that that is plentifull 
in Chium in Eubea also (for there is of this name 
besides this, two more, one a Citie of Caria, and an&#173;
other in Rhodes by Triopia) in effect and working 

</page>

<page sig="a6v">
is farre otherwise, which being aplied or vsed in me&#173;
dicine, drieth vp and burneth. The like dissent is in 
porcions of ground with diuers Inhabitants of op&#173;
posite quarters &#38; Climates, which by comm<expan type="">on</expan> name 
they cal earthes, as in Samia is a most tough earth 
like to that natural Lime which is called Bitumen. 
But let vs come to Brimstone which is <expan type="">the</expan> father of 
Mettals: as Mercurie or Quicksiluer their Mo&#173;
ther. Brimstone saith Harmolaus in Greeke is cal&#173;
led <term lang="gk">Theion</term>. Isidore will haue it called Sulphur, for 
that it soone renneth on fire. It groweth (as they both agree) in the 
yles of Aeolia betweene Sicilie &#38; 
Italie: that is best that groweth in Melus a towne 
of Thessalie which Nicius the Althenien captaine, 
wanne by famishing the inhabitaunts: Further, it 
groweth within the Hilles of Neopolitane, compa&#173;
nions of those which be called Leucogei. Harmolous 
saith, that there be foure kindes heareof. The first 
which is called Apuron liue Alume, &#38; this is solide 
and most massey: almost on clottes, which kind one&#173;
ly Phisicions vse. The second which is called Bo&#173;
lus a lumpe like mettall. The third is called Egula 
vsed commonly of Fullers to make their wull and 
yarne whight. The fourth which is called Cauton 
which they vse in the wicke of Lampes of Oyle &#38; 
Candels. Thus much of this. 

Quicksiluer in Greeke is called <term lang="gk">ydrargyros</term>, it is 
as Cardane saith, a certaine water made thick not by 
heate, bycause it is not hardened, neither by colde, 
for then should it be eyther in the stone his kinde or 
else in the mettals: but with most thinne and pure 
yearthy parte. Whereby it commeth to passe, that it 
is so heauie, so cold, so bright and cleare, so liquide or 
renning. It is rather mingled or tempered after a 
certaine sorte, &#38; that his owne, then congeled or com&#173;
pound, for as much as it is both liquide and fluxible. 
The reason he sheweth why this kinde, (as is also 
the water) are in figure round: for that they refuse 

</page>

<page sig="a7r">
in their felowship drought or any mixture of yearth. 
It sercheth &#38; seketh to the very bottom of ech thing. 
It is for his rawe mixture, of some called metal In&#173;
concret. And as it is with yse which dissolueth, then 
when it vanisheth away, and doth not vanish till it 
be dissolued: in like sorte doth this (but more princi&#173;
pally, all metalles) which doe endure well till that 
they be molten. Dioscorides saith, that this Quick&#173;
siluer is most found in siluer quarries or mines: &#38; is 
then found wh<expan type="">en</expan> Siluer is digged vp: some wil haue 
it founde in Mines by it selfe. It is best of all pre&#173;
serued and kept in those vessels that be of Glasse, of 
Leade, or of Tin and Siluer. All other matter of 
whatsoeuer kinde it is of, it eateth through &#38; flow&#173;
eth forth. It is a deadly drincke ouerlading &#38; brea&#173;
king in sunder the inwarde partes with his waight, 
in remedie wherof many haue taken forthwith Wine 
and Wormewood, and haue bene holpen. 

But nowe to the second part of our first &#38; former 
deuision. Liquores or Iuices be Oyles, Wines, and 
whatsoeuer else is watrie or of <expan type="">the</expan> water &#38; aire. They 
be called Liquores, for eyther being actually moiste&#173;
ned, or else by powre &#38; possibilitie. &#0182; But now let vs 
speake somewhat ingenerallye (as we haue of the o&#173;
ther two) of stones, which supplied in our first deui&#173;
sion, the third rometh. Of Stones some be more base 
and common: other some more Precious and rare: 
but the common Stone hath his name and vocable 
(if I may so say) hurtfoote, for that it is in mouing 
from place to place &#38; iourneying the footes pain and 
griefe. The common stone hath almost infinit kinds 
which offer themselues euerie where, and therefore 
to speake of them particularly, or in seuerall sort, 
it were both tedious and without delight: We 
mought therefore so haue sorted Stones that wee 
mought haue made some of them both base, and com&#173;
mon: other some base, but not yet common: lastly of 
all some neither base nor common but altogither rare 

</page>

<page sig="a7v">
and precious. Of the first sort are all these that are so 
plentifull with vs and without estimation: of the 
seconde sort is the Pumelse concrete of froth as I&#173;
sidore witnesseth, verie colde of nature and in wor&#173;
king so colde as he sayeth, that it beeing cast into a 
Hoggeshead of Wine and continuing there a while 
taketh from the Wine his natural heate. Of the last 
and chiefest sorte are all such as are of greatest price, 
&#38; for mens estimation spent on them, called Gems or 
Iewels: as is that which they call Dionysius stone 
in spots ruddie: and be speckled round about, as that 
of Phrygia, in colour wanne: in waight heauie: in 
vertue hid and secret: as that of Arabie, as white 
as Iuorie: without spot or specke: as likewise the 
Sanguinarie which in Greeke is called <term lang="gk">Amatites</term> 
which being well chafed and rubbed, bleedeth. After 
this sort it hath pleased Dame Nature thus to dal&#173;
ly in eche kinde, thereby to shewe hir cunning. But 
now let vs go to the last part of our deuision. Met&#173;
talles and those of the mettalick sort, sayth Cardane 
lie close for the most parte in Mountaines, in maner 
like to the braunch or body of a tree: and are nothing 
else but the earths hid &#38; occult Plants, hauing their 
roote, their stock or body, their bough &#38; leaues, &#38; be 
in all these partes proportionally dispersed: further 
he sayth, that both Stones and Mettals haue these 
foure partes as those that be necessarie to their vee&#173;
ing and increase: a Roote, Barcke, substance, and 
vaines. The Stone his Roote sayeth he, is eyther 
some other Stone out of the which it groweth, or 
else the earth: <expan type="">the</expan> Mettals Roote is eyther Mettal, 
or some thing Metallick. Their rinde or barck saith 
he, doth differ manifestly fr<expan type="">om</expan> <expan type="">the</expan> rest of their substance, 
both in outward place and hardnesse. Their vaines 
doe appeare manifestly. But thus much shall suffise 
vs to haue spoken of the whole as concerning diuisi&#173;
on. Now let vs come nigh eche of them, and especi&#173;
ally touch the best of them, leauing the rest, foras&#173;
much 

</page>

<page sig="a8r">
as it is our purpose not to seeke in all things 
what may be saide of all, but espeically and princi&#173;
pallye to see what is in them especiall and princi&#173;
pall. And therefore we were about to haue named 
this our Booke the Aegemonie, of Natures three 
middle Daughters: For that in them all, that is 
sought forth, than the which there is nothing better, 
nothing more excellent in all the whole kinde: For 
such is <expan type="">the</expan> Greeke word, <term lang="gk">Aegemonia</term>, as if you would
say Principatus: The best and chiefest of the whole. 
Those other two, that is yearthes and Liquores, 
we purposedly omit: onely couetouse to bestowe and 
employ in this first Booke (but as briefly as we can, 
and in order as chaunceth) our trauaile and diligence 
in inquisition after Stones and Mettals: not that 
which I would, but that which I may for my poore 
skill &#38; knowledge: not to teach or shew the learned, 
howe in this point Nature hath wrought (for that 
were as the prouerb is, <expan type="">the</expan> Sow to Minerua:) But 
to record &#38; repeate in maner of Storie, with the resi&#173;
due of men simple &#38; plaine: And I cannot tell how 
it may somewhat helpe those that be learned also, If 
they shall espie and consider but the effect and proofe 
of these. I therefore desire a Reader not learned, but 
vnskilfull: yet rather learned then immoderate. 
For the one wilbe an impudent rayler: the 
other although hee findeth fault, yet 
shal a man haue him reasonable able 
herein to stay himselfe. Thus 
much of this Preface, 
nowe to the residue 
of our matter. 

Farewell.

SYluer in Gr&#233;eke is called <term lang="gk">Argurion</term>, not far 
from the Latine name and appellation. It 
is compound of the best and purest Quicksil&#173;
uer, and of the most white Brimstone, and that 
which in their mixture and composition, by no 
meanes is burnt to red or black, as Aristotle 
rehearseth. Quicksiluer therefore hath this 
proper and peculiar to it selfe, that it doth not 
gather togither in maner of curd, or waxeth 
thick vnlesse it be intermedled with his fellow 
like acquaintaunce, Brimstone. Therevpon 
Aristotle proueth that Quicksiluer &#38; Brim&#173;
stone are the Elements, that is to say, the Ma&#173;
tere and cause of beginning in all thinges li&#173;
quable or those which melt, which are c<expan type="">om</expan>only

forth and euaporate, whose breath or fume doth 
greatly hurt those, whome it apprehendeth. 
For it bringeth to a man the Palsie, and vn&#173;
doeth and looseneth within him his Sinewes 
and Ioyntes. Without this notwithstanding, 
there could be no mixture, neyther in Golde, 
in Siluer, nor yet in any other Mettall. Siluer 
therefore hath these qualities peculiarly. It is 
cleare, it is shrill of sound, easily ductile, a mar&#173;

IN value more, and in degr&#233;e 
of Nature higher: In Nobilitie 
aboue Stones and Mettals, are 
Plants, if thei had their iust repu&#173;
tati<expan type="">on</expan> &#38; were valued as they should 
be. But herein is corrupt and de&#173;
praued iudgement (I might call it 
abuse, but that this worde is not 
so fit and agreable in all poynts as that other:) and 
therfore it is true that the Poet Gualter saith: Whi&#173;
lest that we being fastned and set vpon pleasures, do 
stray from the right rule of Reason, to satisfie oure 
mindes &#38; to nourish corrupt iudgement, we set most 
by that that is lesse worth: we most esteeme where 
lesse estimation should be, and haue a preposterous 
maner in iudging, and an awke wit in many things, 
their preferment. But this he spake (as it semeth) 
most of all moued with the Vulgar and c<expan type="">om</expan>on sort. 
For the other kinde of men (whome Tullie calleth 
polished and wel addighted in all things) which go&#173;
uerne and stay themselues by wise &#38; prudent mea&#173;
nes, he sawe (vnlesse they were I can not tell, howe 
by some euill meanes bewitched) to reckon and es&#173;
teeme of all things as they were: And therefore he 
may seeme with al intent of mind fully bent to check 
and vpbraide the Multitude, and their basenesse in 
iudgement, whome the aforesaide Tullie trippeth 
eftsones, but especially in his Orati<expan type="">on</expan> had for Cnei&#173;
us Plancie, wheras he reckneth vp a heape of imbe&#173;
cilities and wayes of halting in all office and duties, 
and first after this sort. In the c<expan type="">om</expan>mon sort (saith he) 
is no perfect knowledge or skill, to select or choose 

</page>

<page sig="e1v">
forth amongst many things what is heade and prin&#173;
cipall: there is no sound reason, there is no desart of 
hauing well, there is no industrie or diligence. And 
in his Orati<expan type="">on</expan> for Quintus Roscius after this sort. 
Thus standeth it with the C<expan type="">om</expan>mons. They esteeme 
many things by figure &#38; fantacie, but few veritably 
and vprightly. Further, the selfe same Author in 
his Offices holdeth him not Heroicall or Prince&#173;
like, which leaneth or hangeth vpon them. Wherfore 
let vs go on, and giue them their naturall, pristmate, 
and iust place and order in degree: forasmuch as in 
the other abouesaide, in Mettals &#38; Stones, all is in 
their hid &#38; secret vertue, there making abode &#38; stay 
hereat: vnlesse peraduenture thou be moued wyth 
the goodly shew. Which with <expan type="">the</expan> Sunnes reflexions 
and light, moreouer the shimmering aire &#38; the Met&#173;
tall his purifying more or lesse, meeting all togither, 
one helpeth, coloureth &#38; setteth out another: &#38; thou 
being in loue with so goodly a shew, and brought to 
it by euill accustoming, giuest consent and so wonne 
dost becken at it, and wilt say that it is onely proper 
to the Mettall it selfe: but from <expan type="">that</expan> haue I brought 
thee, &#38; set thee in another beliefe: whereas I spake 
particularly of Golde, Siluer, and such like, if thou 
wilt but onely waye of what stock or houshold they 
be of. But to returne to our purpose. In Plantes 
there is not onelye occult and hid vertue: further&#173;
more, fresh &#38; flourishing colours, wherewith I per&#173;
ceiue thou wouldst be delighted: but there is in them 
that nature that c<expan type="">om</expan>meth somwhat more neare (than 
those other doe) to the principall Creature man. For 
in them is the life vegetatiue or that life which nou&#173;
risheth, augmenteth &#38; bringeth forth his like, more 
apparant also, and in sight more than those other be, 
which lie shut vp in the earth as dead bodies with&#173;
out life, and haue their maner of encrease or decrease 
therein, as all other things incensible haue, and are 
said to quicken or die but vnproperly: In the Plant 

</page>

<page sig="e2r">
it is spoken on that wise properly &#38; after such sort, 
as mankind first next after his conception is saide to 
quicken and continue withall in reaching by meane 
of naturall order to his last kinde, vnperfect at the 
first, by this meane of vnperfection, in the which he 
lyeth and stayeth in after, his conception. 70. dayes, 
and so long is he plantlike: then the rest of time hath 
he in part and parcell like, so disposed and ordred of 
Nature to lay holde on, and to apprehende the other 
life aboue this, called sensitiue, in the which time so 
bespent; he seemeth of no greater accoumpt or force 
than other bruite beastes be, whose propertie is (as 
brute beastes is also the like) to feele griefe and plea&#173;
sure, to moue, to haue sense, and that newly, then be&#173;
gunne by Orgaine or Instrument diuersly framed. 
And then euen then it becommeth to haue an appi&#173;
tite to that which it holdeth good and pleasant, and 
a recesse or lothsomnesse to <expan type="">that</expan> which maketh against 
it. All this at that time, (euen as bruite beasts haue) 
hath man in that not yet finished, &#38; vnperfect shape 
or forme. But the other greater and that which is 
his owne, being once perfect, as to perceyue &#38; iudge 
by sense both inward and outward, to stande in fan&#173;

to proceede further, to be mindfull of, &#38; to haue in re&#173;
membrance or recorde things past, to conferre and 
applie them with the present time, or adiudge there&#173;
by what is in the time c<expan type="">om</expan>ming: to vnderstand, to vt&#173;
ter the thought in way easie to be vnderstoode: this 
diuine power (that I may so say) hath man onely, 
&#38; that man principally &#38; aboue others that is a man 
in deede, and not by appellati<expan type="">on</expan> or name, withal those 
other powers that be in the other two kinds aboue&#173;
saide: but so proportionably wrought; &#38; in such ma&#173;
ner sorted and placed, as the thirde number is ouer 
the first &#38; second, holding and contayning them both 
in his number and accoumpt, but of neyther of them 

</page>

<page sig="e2v">
reckeneth againe in making their accoumpt. The 
Plant therefore is of the Philosophers reckned in <expan type="">the</expan> 
number of those natures, that hath life: for in them 
as Aristotle sayth, is a portion of life, euen as in sa&#173;
uage and brute beastes, sauing that in these last their 
maner of life by way of mouing from place to place, 
by gredie desire to feede and repast themselues, it is 
more manifest: in those other by reason of their a&#173;
bode and continuance all in one place (as setled hard 
to the earth, by roote and moysture) and by their 
more hid receit of necessaries such as maintain them 
being also close and occult, haue giuen great causes 
of doubting. Anaxagoras being moued (I know not 
wherewith) affirmed that there was not onely a de&#173;
sire in them to tarie and continue in their state, but 
also that they had and felt both sorrow and pleasure: 
and his reason he gathered of the distillation of hu&#173;
mor in the Plant his Leaues, and of the Leaues in&#173;
crease. Plato saith that they be moued and led by 
appetite for the necessitie of their prouision in nouri&#173;
shing. But both of these Aristotle in his first booke 
de Plantis, refelleth and reproueth by argument: 
wherevpon we entende not to stande. Yet may it be 
doubted for asmuch as with Theophrast and such o&#173;
thers, rather yea, than nay is aunswered. And they 
bid vs looke in eche their appearance. Doth not the 
Cucumber hate the Oliue, and where the one is, the 
other through a certaine malice prospereth not? C<expan type="">on</expan>&#173;
trariewise, doth not the Vine loue and embrace the 
Elme, &#38; prospereth the better, the nigher one is set 
by another? And as of these question is had, so may 
there also doubtes be made of the other. But let e&#173;
uerie man iudge of these as they list. I had rather be 
still then haue a doe herein. Nowe to their partes 
and maner of diuision. 

Plants be sorted and deuided into three parts: 
the first is the Herbe: the seconde the Shrub: the 
third the Tres: there are which haue added hither 

</page>

<page sig="e3r">
a fourth kind which they cal Suffutrex a mean be&#173;
twene the Herbe and the shrub: but it may better ei&#173;
ther of the one or of the other of these two be called 
as they are called being greater or lesse, th<expan type="">an</expan> to wan&#173;
der so farre for so small aduantage in them by way 
of amplifying diuision. 

The Herbe is that sayth Theophrast in his first 
boke De Plantis and fift Chapter which springeth 
out of his roote well leaued without any body, and
beareth seede vpon his stalke or stemme as al herbs 
do, which are vsed to the Pot. The Shrub is that 
saieth he, which out of the roote commeth vp in ma&#173;
nifold stocke or bodie and shouteth out armes in his 
meane kinde of growth, as the Brome and Brier. 
The tree is that saieth he, that from out of the roote 
ariseth in one onely stock or bodie, and groweth vp 
in manie kinds to great height: beside this it is full 
of boughes, it is full of knots: besides this it is full 
of slips and shootes as the Oliue, the Figge tree, 
the Vine. That other which they call Suffutrex 
and make it the fourth parte hath a certaine thinne 
and small stock: but such a one as excedeth not the 
thinne and small stalk of the herbe: as the Rose and 
such like. Therevpon we may easily perceiue that 
all these kindes aboue saide in that, that they liue 
through the life Vegetatiue and haue their place of 
growth in the earth, and in that, that they all liue 
by heate and humor whereof the first (as that which 
is not much spoken of) seemeth of some to be forgot&#173;
ten in them: further in their leafe and braunches: 
and other outward dispositions herein they all agree 
and are alike. But herein they are saide to differ (as 
all things of sundrie sortes do) in these foure points: 
Whereof the chiefe and principall is their strength 
or vertue. The second their smell, which to the lear&#173;
ned teacheth their contemperature: for the odor and 
smell of ech thing doth much bewraie the thing. The 
thirde difference is fetched from their tast or sauor: 

</page>

<page sig="e3v">
as the one sweete, the other sower, the one plea&#173;
saunt, the other of sharpe tast &#38; vnpleasaunt. More&#173;
ouer as they haue those qualities which be proper 
and peculiar to the tast or want them. The fourth 
is (and that which is most infinite) of their figure 
and forme in leafe, of their owne figure, of their co&#173;
lour, of their flower, of their fruite, of their stock, 
which is as it were the prop or staie of the Plant: 
of the bark, which is the defence (and as I mought 
so say) their house to lodge in: and to defend them&#173;
selues from storme and tempest: further in the roote, 
difference is found, and to haue one worde for all, in

maruelled how Dame Nature hath vpon the face of 
<expan type="">the</expan> earth (as it were in hir Garden or Orchard of de&#173;

tiplied <expan type="">the</expan> kindes of colours either simply died, &#38; stai&#173;

in the excellent shew and infinite their kinde of flo&#173;

some purple coloured as the Violet and Saffron

verie rare) in so much that the sadde blew coloured 
flower, as is Calcedome, hath bene taken of some for 
black, onely for their most like kinde of apparailing. 
So that a man maye see howe Nature worketh in 
many, as in these and sixe hundred more like, after 
simple sort without any intermedling: In as many 
and rather mo as chaungablie. Wherein if I trauai&#173;

Plants may moreouer (to stay and continue yet 
a little in their deuision) so be deuided, that some shal 
be saide to be of the Garden: some of the Field: some 
that like well by the Sea and flouds: some by the 
Sea bancks: other some there be that onely growe 
in Fennes: some vpon rockes and stonie walles: 
some in the sands, and there are which are seene to 
grow in Wels as Liuerwort. Againe some be fruit&#173;
ful, other some barren: some bearing braunches and 
leaues: some <expan type="">with</expan>out al these: some of great growth: 
other of as small: some thicke and grosly set, as the 
Cyprusse: some as rarely and thinly disposed as the 
Beach: some full of knots as it were ioynted or de&#173;
uided as the Reede: some without any such partici&#173;
on, but all ouer plaine: as Hemp. Some which 
spring vp and increase by seede sowing: othersome 
which arise vp of their own accord not known how: 
some most holesome: othersome most hurtfull. And 
to twine vp this threde of deuision vpon some bot&#173;
tome (for it were to long to vndoe the whole skaine) 
some seeme to haue both sexes and kindes: as the 
Oke, the Lawrell and such others: some without 
any such apperaunce but onely one in kinde, as the 
Palme and the like.

The Plant therefore (for of that name we shall

order shewed off, what was their best 
and soueraigne goodnesse. For this is 
the close and wise working of Dame 
Nature, that the further and in degree the more high, she la&#173;
boureth in hirs to haue them reach to the chiefest perfection 
in whome are all things absolute, full and without any point 
of lacke or imperfection, she giueth to eche of them in their 
kinde a seuerall gift. And whereas all of them can not be a&#173;
like, neyther is there in them equall condition, yet for the best 
she prouideth for them in that that may be: alwayes foreseing 
to auoyde impossibilitie. I mought here therefore set these two 
last Daughters, the plant and eke the brute Beast, the one 
from the other by this note and difference (for many men haue 
children alike, and yet they are knowne and haue their diffe&#173;
rence by one marke or other) First and formost in mouing 
from place to place, with an appetite to repast themselues: and 
this is the chiefest, vsed and sought forth of Philosophers: the 
next in feeling and sense, perceiuing griefe and paine, good 
and euill. And herein and in these, they chiefely dissent. In&#173;
somuch <expan type="">that</expan> the Plant is only portioned with the life vegetatiue, 
and therein in euery eche power fully &#38; aboundantly. This 
other last steppeth vp a Stayer higher, layth holde and ap&#173;
prehendeth another kinde of life in degree more Princely, 
and in force or large power most manifolde: for with this, it 
hath might to moue, to haue lust or appetite: to haue and hunt 
after what it will, and to wander and straye therefore whe&#173;
ther it will, neyther ought that to be reckned ought which A&#173;
naxagoras and Empedocles, men partiall in this poynt 
reasoned: Whereas they spake of that other the Plant his 
prayse. Insomuch, that they would perswade others of theyr 
time, that in that kinde there was both mouing abroade and 
appetite to that which it perceiueth to be best: but they are re&#173;

</page>

<page sig="k3v">
futed of Aristotle by sundrie and sufficient reasons whereof 
we entend not to speake: onely feeling our selues to gainesay 
them herein, with this one reason chosen forth of the rest, that 
Aristotle vseth. If they haue sense and appetite, they muste 
needes haue feeling: if they haue feeling, they must needes 
haue organe, &#38; parts instrumentall for the maner of feeling. 
But in the Plant there is none such perceyued: Therefore 
with so little a trip they are cleane cast downe. Further some 
of them ad (but that which may be the more borne withal) that 
many of the kindes of Plants haue both Male and Female, 
As Empedocles and his like: of whome I demaund whether 
<expan type="">that</expan> they haue coniunction yea or no? or whether they haue those 
parts which be destined to procreation yea or no? and lastly, 
whether they conieyne eche other with their like? for <expan type="">the</expan> Male 
sayth Aristotle is that which <expan type="">the</expan> coniunction begetteth his like 
in another. The female that which likewise doth euen so 
with another. But in this last they may be the more suffered, 
for that Aristotle himselfe in the conclusion and winding vp 
of his former booke De Plantis, doth as it were distinguish 
those of the same kindes, although they haue a nighe resem&#173;
blance and are taken of some for all one. And thus sayth he, 
you shall know the Male from the Female. The Male is of 
more spisse or tough braunches: of leafe and boughe, more a&#173;
boundaunt: of lesse humor or moysture than the Female: yet 
more forwarde in ripening. And hath his leafe and slippes 
also differing. The Female hath all these, but nothing like 
in number, affection and qualitie. But we minde not thus to 
giue back or to slip aside with any more conference or compa&#173;
rison had. Let vs fall now to euery thing liuing and Crea&#173;
ture of life his accustomed deuision. All liuing Creatures 
therefore (I do here necessarily but vnwillingly comprehend 
man not meaning to speake what his soueraigntie is nor what 
is in him best, but purposed to stay before I come at him, who 
standeth on the stayer a step higher than we meane to climbe: 
but speaking of liuing Creatures, my meaning is of brute 
Beastes, the worde restrayned and cut a little short.) First to 
go to their place where they accustome to liue, differ thus. For 
one part of them liueth vpon the earth, another in the Sea &#38; 
Waters, the thirde part in both doubtfully: so that one while 
they keepe in the brode ayre: anotherwhile in the water, and 
earth as the Crocodile. Those of the earth some of them haue 
feete to go with: some creepe: some swim: some flie. The next 
difference is noted and perceyued in their maner and kinde 
of liuing, as Aristotle witnesseth; in his bookes De animali&#173; 

</page>

<page sig="k4r">
bus very often. Some sayth he, be as it were milde, hurtfull 
to no bodie, as the Bullock, the Goate, the poore and sielye 
Sheepe: other of such fiercenesse, and so wilde that they can 
not be tamed, as the Tyger, the wilde Boare, and other of 
haughtie stomacke as the Lyon: other some of increadible 
might or strength, as is the Elephant, the Cammell, and such 
like: other after a sort subtile and why, working man much e&#173;
uill and displeasure, as the craftie Fox, the deuouring Wolfe 
and so forth. Plinie as concerning this matter hath this di&#173;
uision. All Beastes sayth he, or Creatures liuing, hath this 
difference: some be full of bloud, whereby they be long liued, 
as the Hart, the Hinde, the Roe, other are without bloud: 
but in stead thereof haue their naturall humor: as the Bee, 
the Waspe, the Betle, the Flie. All which are of wrethed &#38; 
parted bodie. Againe he sayth, some difference is in them for 
their foode: for that the most part to accoumpt of, of all maner 
Beastes, liue by flesh, and be called in Greeke <term lang="gk">Cinophagai</term>: 
other are indifferent for that matter, and eate that, as other 
things, when they may come by it: as the Dogge, the fleeing 
Eagle, and the like. Some againe, which will none of it: as 
for the most part all Foules of the Ayre, and Fishes of the 
Sea. Further, some be of good memorie, or retaine for a time 
in their head a good turne done to them or an euill as <expan type="">the</expan> Dog,
the Lion, the Cammell: Other as forgetfull of such kinde of 
deseruing, and vnmindefull as the Ostrich, the Doue. And 
there is in some a certaine kinde of perceiueraunce and ad&#173;
iudging or esteeming what is what (but the same spoken of vs 
by resemblance and vnproperly) which we may perceiue they 
haue through their care in bringing vp &#38; tendring their yong: 
as also in artificiall maner of building their Nest, in hunting 
and seeking after their pray, in remedying and curing woun&#173;
des: in espying what shall hurt them: And further in some 
through foreknowledge and skill to prognosticate what shall 
afterwards happen by storme &#38; tempest: as is the Swallow 
by his departure, when colde and Winter begin to come in. 
As is the wilde Crane, which also sheweth vs through hir 
flight from place to place, wheras exceeding Frosts shall be: 
And there is not this onely in the Crane, laudable or prayse 
worthy, but that which requireth farre greater praise and long 
time to admiration. Aristotle sayth, that he hath marked this 
that when the Cranes by companie, flie ouer the broad Sea 
(which is large, wide, and infinite) to continue in that their 
passage the better without rescue, and to endure to the ende, 
they vse this knack or practise. Their c<expan type="">om</expan>panie then is brought 

</page>

<page sig="k4v">
into fiues, and so they flie two a breast, and the fift or odde 
Crane in maner of a persiue sterne, to make the other way in 
the Ayre, flieth all alone before, till he be wearie so doing: 
when he is wearie, another goeth and taketh vpon him his of&#173;
fice and painetaking, and that other commeth to their place 
which be of breast, and in like sort doe all the other by course, 
till their iourney be at an end: and so their flight is like a 
Triangle, sharpe at the ende, and broade about, and easied 
therewithall by one another his helping. Againe (to leaue 
their entrailes and inward parts so to come by deuision) they 
are sayde to differ in outwarde attire and kinde of aray: for 
some haue haire for their vpper Garment: some haue onely 
their bare skin: other haue feathers: other haue hide: other 
haue their skin full of prickles and briestles: and (to speake 
of their maner of defending themselues) som haue sting, some 
haue tuskes, some haue hornes: othersome helpe themselues 
by flyght and lightnesse of wings: and as for their voice, some 
haue soft voice: some as loud and shrill. The Cow saith Ari&#173;
stotle, is in voyce more loud than the mightie Bull. I coulde 
gather also differences in shewing how euerie part is placed 
both within and without, not all alike: moreouer, of their vse 
and purpose, of their affection also, of their settes and dispo&#173;
sition in life: but I had rather (as they say lose the Hare) then 
to take such infinite paines as to hunt so farre for hir. I will 
therefore now make hast home againe, peraduenture <expan type="">the</expan> num&#173;
ber of companie of Myles going, in taking such paynes, would 
wearie vs: It is counted wisedome not to take to much 
vpon a man, neither more than he can well suffer. 
But now to euery liuing thing or Creature his 
soueraigntie, so farre forth as we can, our 
Pen and Hande shall hasten. And 
first let vs begin Alphabetically 
(as in the residue of our 
work before) with

Briers and Brembles. And Aristotle semeth 
to becken to him, for that he sayth thus. The 
Asse by briestling amongest the Bushes and 
Briers hindreth the small Birdes in bringing

therefore the little Sparrowes doe him all the 
mischiefe that they can. And will often peck at

much of him, and who hurteth him. Therfore 
vpon his Mayster he commonly fawneth: to 
straungers he is eger and curst. In histories 
there is such recorde &#38; testimonie of their loue 
had and borne to their Maisters, that the Mai&#173;

miscarying, the Dog also euen with his Mai&#173;

some, who hauing had but the sight of the dead 
Corps of their Maister, by lamentation, and 
by bewayling at his side neuer ioyed after, but 
perished and famished with long howling &#38;

throng and assembly of people, that with fierce 
barcking and byting, at the last he compelled

Maister a little while after, being condemned, 
and put to death or execution, and the dead bo&#173;

howled most lamentably, and being compas&#173;

people, wherof one of them casting him meate 
thus howling to make him holde his peace, he 
caried it forthwith and put it to the mouth of 
his Maister their lying dead, whose dead corps 
anone after being throwne into Tyber the 
d&#233;epe floud or Riuer, the Dogge swam after it 
hastily with entent to vpholde and sustaine it, 
with merueylous astonying and wonder of 
the people had, that such a kinde of faith should 
be in a dumbe beast. And so with heauing vp

she bringeth forth &#38; deliuereth hir yong with 
much paine and griefe. For when as hir belly

deliuered, (as they also couet to be out of so

of their Mothers side, &#38; so with both their great 
griefe, and most often their Dams destruction, 
they come out &#38; are borne. I sid. saith that their

AS <term lang="la">Vatinius Seruilius</term> in his life time was 
hated &#38; approchfully spoken of for that he like a 
Snaile spent all his life time in ease and ydlenesse, 
without any fruite that he gathered either to better 
himselfe or others: so contrariwise could Cleanthes 
the Philosopher well away with labour and paine&#173;
taking in writing after his sort: &#38; was glad to vtter 
abrode <expan type="">that</expan> that was in him best to doe. And as Cle&#173;
anthes is yet spoken of, not for any great workes of 
his, or for that he in stile and inditing excelled other: 
but for that he employed all his endeuour to the c<expan type="">om</expan>&#173;
moditie of others: so haue I (gentle Reader) one 
as farre behinde Cleanthes, as he was the sect and 
Geneologie of the Peripaticians, somewhat vnlaced 
or vnripped, some of the Seames of the thirde quar&#173;
ter of Philosophies attire or aray: (for hir whole 
coate as we reade, hath but three quarters: the one 
called Dialectike: the other Morall or Ciuill: the 
thirde naturall or wonderfull.) Although I haue 
not shewed thee hir altogither naked which thing 
Aristotle &#38; others of his sect, as also Albert &#38; Pli&#173;
nie haue done: the sight or shew whereof if thou co&#173;
uerest, I would wish thee to resort to these: For 
theirs is the Fountaine: and mine a small Arme 
thereof. Yet had I rather be an arme eyther of these 
or of some other as Cleanthes was, then to be no&#173;
thing at all as was Vatinius. And yet for all this 
when I had enterprised this, I was not ignorant 
that Sicconius that ment so wel, had his Catullus: 
euerie Turnus had his Drances: euerie Cicero had 
his Salust: &#38; for such his malice is now called Cice&#173;
romastix Ciceros whip. Likewise euerie Plato hath 
his Xenophon. Varro hath his Palemon, yea &#38; this

Queane take heede least she at the request of Scylla 
be not turned into a Sea monster. And let muttring 
Mutius take heede least he be serued with the same 
sawce. Virgil requited Bauius and Meuius. Fur&#173;
ther, let these vnderstande that euerie man is not at 
Corinth. Neither can euerie man carrie a Palme or 
Lawrel Cheeke by Cheeke with Orpheus or Dor&#173;

Harpe. Tell me, canst thou play after Tellens tune, 
or haue this to be thy peculiar Prouerbe? Cane ea 
que sunt Tellenis. Sing after Tellens sort: that 
is to say, sing sweetly, or let vs heare a heau<expan type="">en</expan>ly noise. 
No. Let not euery man looke to play and striue with 
Tellen or with Agathon. It shall suffice vs to haue 
Philomelus his cunning. And ye Hellyconians, al&#173;
though that Babys come in in place amongst you: 
as he did when as Minerua played so sweetely, yet 
if he shall disquiet you (as Babys did Minerua) 
shame him not with ieasting or iarring (no more th<expan type="">en</expan>

nough (whatsoeuer he be) if that he playeth &#38; har&#173;

haue better perfection and ripenesse. And thus much 
I had to the learned sort. The other I doe not mis&#173;
trust: for whom principally I was couetous to be&#173;
stowe this such my trauaile, and will (if I shall see 
them thankefull hereafter) more aboundantlye to
