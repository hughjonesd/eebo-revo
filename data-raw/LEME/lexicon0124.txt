Planimetra and Stereometriea, containing Rules manifolde
for mensuration of all lines, Superfices and Solides. With
sundry straunge conclusions both by instrument

A Mathematical Discourse of Geometrical solides.

<heading>The Preface.</heading>

ALthough the Rules and Preceptes already geuen abun&#173;
dantly may suffice for the exact mensuration of any m<expan type="">an</expan>&#173;
ner Solides or vessels that are vsually occupied, or may
be proponed to be moten, yet for the satisfaction also of
such as deliting in matters only new, rare and difficile,
seeke to reache aboue the common sorte, I haue thought
good to adioyne this Treatise of the 5 Platonicall bodies,
meaning not to discourse of their secrete or mysticall appliances to the
Elementall regions and frame of Celestiall Spheres, as things remote
and farre distant from the Methode, nature and certaintie of Geometrical
demonstration, only heere I intend Mathematically to c<expan type="">on</expan>ferre the Super&#173;
ficiall and Solide capacities of these Regulare bodies with their Circum&#173;
scribing or inscribed spheres or Solides, &#38; Geometrically by Algebraycall
Calculations to search out the sides, Diameters, Axes, Altitudes, and lines
Diagonal, together with the Semidimetients of their Equiangle Bases,
containing or contained Circles, and as in the Problemes ye shal perceiue
by Preceptes and Examples, the quantities and proportions of all these
lines, Superficies and Crassitudes, with numbers Rationall and Radicall
expressed, so haue I by Theoremes sowne the seede of Rules innumerable,
wherin the studious may delite him selfe with infinite varietie: Finally I
shall in the last Chapiter by Diffinitions and Theoremes partly set forthe
the forme, nature and proportion of other fiue vniforme Geometricall So&#173;
lides, created by the transformation of the fiue bodyes Regulare or Plato&#173;
nicall: but not in so ample manner, as the noueltie or difficultie of the mat&#173;
ter requireth, meaning as I see these the first frutes of my studies liked and
accepted, to bestowe time and trauaile vppon an other peculiare Volume,

<page sig="T1r">
which shall conteyne, not onely the demonstrations of these Theorems
of spherall solides, but also of Conoydall, Parabollical, Hyperbollical and

produced by the sections of these, and reuolution of their secti<expan type="">on</expan>s: but to re&#173;
turne to this present Treatise, let no man muse <expan type="">the</expan> writing in the English

standing the copiouse and abundante eloquence of their toung, haue
not shamed to borrow of the Gretians these and many other termes of
arte: so surely do I thinke it no reproche, either to the English toung,
or any English writer, where fitte words fayle to borrow of them both,
but rather should we seeme therby to do them great iniurie, these beeing
in deede certayne testimonies and memorials where such sciences firste
tooke their originall, and in what languages and countreys they chieflye
florished, which names or words how straunge soeuer they seeme at the
firste acquayntaunce, by vse will grow as familiar as these, a triangle, a
circle, or suche like, which by custome and continuance seeme meere En&#173;
glish, yet to auoyde all obscuritie that may grow by the noueltie of them,
I haue adioyned euery of their diffinitions, and so proceded to Problems
and Theoremes with suche methode, as howe obscure or harde soeuer
they appeare at the firste, through the rarenesse of the matter: I 
doubt not but by orderly reading, the ingeniouse Student,
hauing any meane taste of cossicall numbers, shall
finde them playne and easie.

A Metamorphosis or transformation of the fiue
regulare bodies.

HItherto haue I onely intreated of the fiue regulare bodies.
Theoretically and practically opening sundrie meanes to
search out the proportion and quantities of their sides,
diameters, axes, perpendiculares, altitudes, and contentes
both superficiall and solide, and that not onely in these so&#173;
lides considered by them selues, but also conferred with other, aswell by
inscription as circumscription, both of themselues and their spheres: so
as I suppose hardely any question may be proponed concerning these bo&#173;
dies, whiche by the formal problemes or theoremes may not be resol&#173;
ued. Yet before I finishe this Treatise I thought good to adioyne one
Chapter of the transformation of these Solides into suche bodies (as
though they may not be tearmed regulare, for that Euclide hath demon&#173;
strate onely fiue, and no mo possibly to be founde or imagined) yet haue
they such vniforme composition and conuenience with these solides, that
they are not onely enuironed with equilater and equiangle superficies
as they be, but also haue all their sides equall, and one comprehending
sphere exactly and at once touching all their solide angles, they are also
capable of the regulare bodies, and onely herein different, that whereas
the regulare solides be inuironed with one kinde of playnenes and re&#173;
ceiue one internal sphere, and so consequently one axis. These Transfor&#173;
med bodies are incompassed with seuerall kinde of playnesse, and haue se&#173;
uerall axes and contayned spheres, of which their diuersitie aryseth ma&#173;

<page sig="Ff4v">
nyfolde mo straunge, rare, and differente kinds of proportions, than may
in a very large volume (I will not saye be demonstrate, but onely by 
Theoremes) be declared. Transformed regulare solydes I call them,
both to auoyde the forging of newe names, which I should be inforced to
vse for distinction sake, and also bicause they seeme to be created by the
vnifourme section of the regulare bodies, and may by addition of certaine
proportionall equall Pyramides, be reduced to the regulare solides, and
are in sundry proportions and proprieties so agreable and resemblante
to those regulare solides, whose names they beare, that they seeme onely
to lose the fourme, and yet still to retayne the nature of them. I meane
not here in so ample maner as the noueltie of the matter requireth to in&#173;
treate of them, but onely by diffinitions and Theoremes open so muche
as may be sufficient to explane the composition, fourme, nature, and pro&#173;
portion of these, and also giue light to the ingeniouse infinitely to pro&#173;
ceede for inuention of the like, whose vse and appliance may be manyfold
to conclusions no lesse straunge than necessarie: but thereof in due place
for the nature of these transfourmed solides peruse their seuerall diffini&#173;
