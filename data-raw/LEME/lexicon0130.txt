Certayne rules of Geo&#173;
graphie, for the vnderstanding of 
Mappes and Chartes.

THe perfect vnderstanding of Mappes
and the vse of the same dothe consiste
in the knowledge of these foure poynts.

1 The necessarie circles described in
Mappes.
2 The longitude &#38; latitude of places.
3 The Clymats and Paraleles.
4 The measure of distaunce of one
place from another.

<xpln lexeme="equinoctial(a)" lexeme="tropic(n)" lexeme="polar(a)" lexeme="zone, temperate(n)" lexeme="zone, cold(n)" lexeme="zone, burnt(n)">The circles expressed in Mappes are
fiue, the Equinoctiall, the 2. Tropikes, and
the two Polare circles.

The Equinoctiall or Equator, is a cir&#173;
cle imagined iust in the midst betweene
the two Poles, compassing the whole
earth about.

1 This circle deuideth the worlde in&#173;
to two equall parts, that is to saye, the

</page>

<page sig="a2v">
North and the South.

2 It serueth also to know the Longi&#173;
tude of places, which is measured vpon
it, and the Latitude which is measured 
from it, either Northwarde or South&#173;
warde.

3 When the Sunne is in it, the day is
equall with the nighte throughout all
the worlde.

4 When the Sunne is furthest from
it, the day is either shortest or longest.

The Tropikes are those circles which
the Sunne maketh about the worlde,
when it is furthest from the Equinoctial
either Northwarde or Southwarde.

If it be Northwarde it is called the
Tropike of Cancer, bicause the Sunne
then returning backwardes entreth into
that signe.

If it be Southwarde it is called the 
Tropike of Capricorne, bicause then the
Sunne entreth into the signe of Capri&#173;
corne.

These circles do deuide the temperate
Zones from the burnt Zone.

</page>

<page sig="a3r">
The Polare circles are those which the
Poles of the Zodiake doe make aboute
the Poles of the worlde, in the space of
24. houres.

They deuide the temperate Zones
from the colde Zones: and are so farre
distant from their Poles (that is, the Ar&#173;
ctike from the North, and the Antartike 
from the South Pole) as the Tropikes
are from the Equinoctiall.

The two Tropikes and the two Po&#173;
lare circles do deuide the whole earthe
into fiue parts, which are called Zones.
Wherof that which lieth vnder the E&#173;
quinoctiall betweene the two Tropikes,
is called the burnte Zone: the other
two betwixt either of the Tropikes and
the Polare circles are called Temperate
Zones: and the other two vnder either 
Pole are called colde Zones.

uersall Chartes, you haue lines (called
Meridians) drawne in lengthe from
Pole to Pole, distant one from another

To apply your degrees to the finding
out of the distance of one place from an
other, by the number of miles (as they
are c<expan type="">om</expan>monly taken  amongst vs in Eng&#173;
lande) you must vnderstande that euery
degree containeth, 60. miles on earth, so
that if you multiplie .360. degrees, which
is the compasse of the Equinoctial, by 60. 
you shall finde the worlde to conteine a&#173;
boute the whole circumference of the
earth and water 21600. miles.

If you take your measure of distance
from the Equinoctiall line directly either
Northwarde or Southward, or else vp&#173;
pon the Equinoctiall line Eastwarde or
Westwarde, you neede no more but
count your degrees, and for euery degree
count .60. miles: or if your Chart be true
in proportion, open your compasse as
wide as those two places are asunder,
whose distance you woulde knowe, and
apply the same to the Equinoctiall line,
and multiplye your degrees as before,
and so you shall haue your purpose.

In particular <emend err="and">in</emend> Chorographical

<page sig="a7r">
Chartes you may finde the true distance
of any place from another, either by the 
numbers of longitude and latitude de&#173;
scribed in the margine of your Chart, or
by the Scale which is moste commonly
made for that purpose. And if you wante
bothe these helpes, take any two places
wherof you knowe or may learne the 
true distance, and measure that,
and according to that propor&#173;
tion you may finde out
any distaunce in
