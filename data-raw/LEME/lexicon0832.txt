the <f type="i">Grecians<f type="r"> reckon'd from one Celebration of the <f type="i">Olym&shy;
pick<f type="r"> Games to another. The first <f type="i">Olympiad<f type="r"> begun the 
Year of the World 3174. 776 Years before the Christian 
<f type="i">&AElig;ra<f type="r"> or Birth of Christ. <f type="i">Olympiads<f type="r"> were the <f type="i">Epocha<f type="r">'s of the 
<f type="i">Grecians<f type="r">; their Name is derived from the <f type="i">Olympick<f type="r"> 
Games, instituted by <f type="i">Iphitus<f type="r"> to the Honour of <f type="i">Hercules<f type="r">. 
They were celebrated every fifth Year about the Sum&shy;
mer Solstice or the 19th of <f type="i">Iuly<f type="r">, at a Town of <f type="i">Elis<f type="r"> in 
the <f type="i">Peleponesus<f type="r"> (now the <f type="i">Morea<f type="r">) called <f type="i">Olympia<f type="r">. Some 
are of Opinion, That <f type="i">Iphitus<f type="r"> was not the Instituter, 
but only the Restorer of those Games, after they had 
been neglected and laid aside for some time.

However, after he had once fixed them, they were 
since solemnized, without Interruption, at the begin&shy;
ning of every fifth Year. The ancientest and most 
esteemed of those Exercises was the <f type="i">Race<f type="r">, to which 
<f type="i">Wrestling<f type="r"> was afterwards added; and because the 
<f type="i">Athletes<f type="r"> did Wrestle naked, neither the Laws nor De&shy;
cency did suffer Women to be there Spectators. The 
Prize given to the Victor, was a Garland of 
Laurel. <f type="i">Corebus<f type="r">, a Cook, according to <f type="i">Atheneus<f type="r">, car&shy;
ried the Price of the Race, at the first <f type="i">Olympiad<f type="r">.</xpln></wordentry>

<wordentry type="h"><form lang="en" lexeme="epoch(n)">EPOCHA</form> <xpln lang="en"> is a fixed Point, or a certain and re&shy;
markable Time in History, made use of in <f type="i">Chronology<f type="r"> 
to begin to compute Years, and which is generally 
grounded upon some great and signal Event.

&AElig;RA is the same Thing with <f type="i">Epocha<f type="r">, since it signi&shy;
fies also a fixed and determined Point among Histori&shy;
ans, to begin to reckon Years. The Word <f type="i">&AElig;ra<f type="r"> comes 
from the Latin <f type="i">&AElig;s<f type="r">, because they used to mark Years 
with little Copper Studs. Perhaps it has its Original 
from the Ignorance of some Amanuenses, who, finding 
these Letters <term lang="la"><f type="i">A.E.R.A. Annus erat Regni Augusti<f type="r"></term>, did 
make but one Word of them, <f type="i">&AElig;ra<f type="r">. Some are of Opi&shy;
nion, That this Word was introduced by the <f type="i">Spaniards<f type="r">, 
who had drawn it from a Tribute which the Emperor 
<f type="i">Augustus<f type="r"> had made them liable to; so that <f type="i">&AElig;ra<f type="r"> must 
come from <f type="i">&AElig;re.<f type="r">
</page>

<page sig="b3r">
We have, at present, two different <f type="i">Christian &AElig;ra's<f type="r">. 
The first is the <f type="i">Vulgar &AElig;ra<f type="r">, whose Author is <f type="i">Dionysius<f type="r">, 
sirnam'd <f type="i">Exiguus<f type="r">, a Learned Monk that flourish'd about 
the beginning of the Sixth Century, who, out of respect 
to our Saviour's Birth, thought it fit that Christians 
should begin to reckon their Years from the coming of 
the <f type="i">Messiah<f type="r">. His Design was approv'd of and follow'd. 
And hence it is that we use this Form in publick Busi&shy;
ness and Writings, <f type="i">In the Year of our Lord<f type="r">, or <f type="i">The Year 
of our Redemption<f type="r">, 1698. But this <f type="i">Dionysius<f type="r">, notwith&shy;
standing that he was a Man of Learning and Integrity, 
has committed a Mistake of four Years; for 'tis certain, 
That our Vulgar <f type="i">&AElig;ra<f type="r"> is so much short of the Birth of 
JESUS CHRIST.

The second <f type="i">Christian &AElig;ra<f type="r"> is the <f type="i">true<f type="r"> one, which be&shy;
gins four Years before the <f type="i">Vulgar<f type="r">; so that this present 
Year, instead of 1698. we ought to reckon 1702. from 
the Birth of our Saviour. But although this last be the 
true <f type="i">&AElig;rara<f type="r">, we shall nevertheless follow that of <f type="i">Dionysius<f type="r">, 
only to comply with common Usage. But lest we 
lead any Body into an Error, instead of saying, for 
Example, this present Year from the Birth of <f type="i">Iesus 
Christ<f type="r">, 1698. which is false by four Years, we shall 
say of the <f type="i">Vulgar &AElig;rara<f type="r">, 1698. and then all is right; 
provided we take this along with us, viz. That the 
first Year of the <f type="i">Vulgar &AElig;rara<f type="r"> begins at the fifth of our 
Saviour. We shall observe all along the same Exact&shy;
ness upon a like Occasion.

There are three sorts of <f type="i">Epocha's<f type="r">. The First is <f type="i">Sa&shy;
cred<f type="r">; the Second <f type="i">Ecclesiastical<f type="r">; and the Third <f type="i">Civil<f type="r"> or 
<f type="i">Politick<f type="r">.

I. <f type="i">Sacred Epocha<f type="r">'s are those we gather from the Bible, 
and which particularly concern the History of the 
<f type="i">Iews<f type="r">. As, 
1. The Creation. 
2. The Deluge, in the Year of the World, 1656. 
3. The Calling of <f type="i">Abraham<f type="r">, 2023. 
4. The <f type="i">Iews<f type="r"> coming out of <f type="i">Egypt<f type="r">, 2453. 
5. The Foundation of the Temple of <f type="i">Solomon<f type="r">, 2933. 
6. The Liberty granted to the <f type="i">Iews<f type="r"> by <f type="i">Cyrus<f type="r">, 3419. 
</page>
 
<page sig="b3v">
7. The Birth of the <f type="i">Messiah<f type="r">, the Salvation of the 
<f type="i">Iews<f type="r">, and the enlightening of the <f type="i">Gentiles<f type="r">, 3948 or 50.

8. The Destruction of the Temple of <f type="i">Ierusalem<f type="r">, and 
the Dispersion of the <f type="i">Iews<f type="r">, the Year of the World, 
3969. of JESUS CHRIST, 74. and of the <f type="i">Vulgar 
&AElig;rara<f type="r">, 70.

II. <f type="i">Ecclesiastical Epocha<f type="r">'s are those which we take out 
of the Authors who have writ the History of the Church 
since the Birth of our Saviour, <f type="i">viz.<f type="r"> 

1. The Martyrdom of <f type="i">Peter<f type="r"> and <f type="i">Paul<f type="r"> at <f type="i">Rome<f type="r">, in 
the Year of the <f type="i">Vulgar &AElig;rara<f type="r">, 67. 

2. The <f type="i">&AElig;rara<f type="r"> of <f type="i">Dioclesian<f type="r">, or of the Martyrs, 302.

3. Peace given to the Church by <f type="i">Constantine<f type="r"> the 
Great, the first Christian Emperor, 312. 

4. The Council of <f type="i">Nice<f type="r">, called against the Heresy 
of <f type="i">Arius<f type="r">, 325.

III. <f type="i">Civil<f type="r"> or <f type="i">Political Epocha<f type="r">'s are those which regard 
the Empires and Monarchies of the World; such as, 

1. The taking of <f type="i">Troy<f type="r"> by the <f type="i">Grecians<f type="r"> the Year of the 
World, 2767. before the <f type="i">Vulgar Christian &AElig;rara<f type="r">, 1183 
Years, and 407 before the first <f type="i">Olympiad<f type="r">. 

2. The Building of <f type="i">Rome<f type="r">, according to <f type="i">Fabius Pi&shy;
ctor<f type="r">, who wrote first about <f type="i">Roman<f type="r"> Affairs, is fixed a lit&shy;
tle before the VIIIth <f type="i">Olympiad<f type="r">, on the 13th of the <f type="i">Ka&shy;
lends<f type="r"> of <f type="i">May<f type="r">; that is, in the Year of the World, 3198. 
and 752. Years before the <f type="i">Vulgar &AElig;rara<f type="r">.

Nevertheless <f type="i">Varro<f type="r"> places it five whole Years higher, 
viz. in the Year of the World, 3193.

3. The <f type="i">&AElig;rara<f type="r"> of the <f type="i">Seleucides<f type="r">, from whence the <f type="i">Ma&shy;
cedonians<f type="r"> began to reckon their Years, is also called 
the <f type="i">Grecian Years<f type="r">, chiefly used by the <f type="i">Iews<f type="r"> since they 
were subjected to the <f type="i">Macedonians<f type="r">. This <f type="i">&AElig;rara<f type="r"> begins 
at the Reign of <f type="i">Seleucus Nicanor<f type="r">, one of the Captain 
of <f type="i">Alexander the Great<f type="r">, in the Year of the World, 3638 
and 312 Years before the <f type="i">Vulgar &AElig;rara<f type="r">. 

4. <f type="i">The first Iulian Year<f type="r">. This Year begins at the 
Reformation of the <f type="i">Roman<f type="r"> Kalendar, made by <f type="i">Iulius 
C&aelig;sar<f type="r">. The Times of the <f type="i">Roman Fasti<f type="r"> were so con&shy;
founded, through the Negligence of the High-Priests 
that <f type="i">Iulius C&aelig;sar<f type="r">, being himself raised to that Dignity
</page>

<page sig="b4r">
thought it his Duty to correct the Abuses which his 
Predecessors had tolerated. His first Care, assoon as he 
came to be Head of the Republick, was to regulate all 
Things belonging to Religion. He made use of the 
Skill of <f type="i">Sosigenes<f type="r">, an excellent Astronomer, in order to 
reform the Kalendar; and assigned the Year as many 
Days as the Sun takes up in passing through the XII 
Signs of the <f type="i">Zodiack<f type="r">; since that time the common Year 
consists of 365 Days. This Reformation was made in 
the Year of the World, 3905. and 45 before the <f type="i">Vul&shy;
gar &AElig;rara<f type="r">.

5. The <f type="i">Hegira<f type="r"> or <f type="i">Flight of Mahomet<f type="r">: When that Im&shy;
postor had for some Years been propagating his false 
Doctrin at <f type="i">Mecca<f type="r">, and had gain'd a large Party to his 
Side, they became Insolent and gave Offence to the 
Government, which occasion'd the Magistrates to op&shy;
pose that growing Faction, and thereby oblig'd <f type="i">Maho&shy;
met<f type="r"> to quit that Place, and fly to a neighbouring Town 
where his Party were more powerful. From this Flight 
of their Prophet, which happen'd on the 16th of <f type="i">Iuly<f type="r">, 
in the Year of the <f type="i">Vulgar &AElig;ra<f type="r">, 622. the <f type="i">Turks<f type="r"> date their 
Writings; which they first took up on occasion of a 
Quarrel concerning a Payment; for a Debtor had given 
his Obligation to pay a Sum of Mony on such a Day 
of such a Month; which Month being past at the time 
of the Demand, the Debtor alledg'd it was not before 
the next Year that he was to Pay; which being brought 
before <f type="i">Omar III<f type="r">. Emperor of the <f type="i">Saracens<f type="r">, he found 
the Inconvenience of not having a Method of ascer&shy;
taining the Year, and accordingly instituted the <f type="i">Hegira<f type="r"> 
for an <f type="i">Epocha<f type="r">.</xpln></wordentry>

We suppose, in <f type="i">Chronology<f type="r">, this Period to be 765

</wordgroup1>

I have had no regard, in all this Work, to the <f type="i">Iulian 
Period<f type="r">, with which it is not proper to trouble and puzzle 
those who study <f type="i">Chronology<f type="r">, only in their way to <f type="i">History<f type="r">. 
Therefore I have fitted all the <f type="i">Epocha<f type="r">'s to the Years of 
the World, and the Years either before or after the 
<f type="i">Vulgar &AElig;ra<f type="r">, the beginning of which I place (according 
to the most skilful in this sort of Study) in the Year of 
the World, 4004. One can never be too careful in re&shy;
moving Difficulties from a Subject, which is so intricate 
of it self. For after all, if you tell young People, and 
even those that are come to Man's Estate, That the <f type="i">Iu&shy;
lian Period<f type="r"> begins 765 Years before the World, you'll 
amaze them to that degree, that tho' you tell them 
afterwards, That this is but a Supposition; you will 
have much ado to bring them back again to themselves. 
Now this Period was invented to no other purpose, than 
to square by it all the other <f type="i">Epocha<f type="r">'s, and reconcile, if 
possible, Chronologers one to another; and therefore it 
does not concern those who have only a Mind to learn 
History, and whom it were unjust to engage in minute 
Punctilio's of <f type="i">Chronology<f type="r">, which have been ever look'd 
upon as Thorns very difficult and troublesome to 
handle.
