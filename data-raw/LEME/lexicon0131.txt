ment for the Sea.

The names of certaine things necessarie to be known of them that
are Mariners or Seafaring men, meete to bee knowne of them
that doe practise Nauigation, as this: the names of the circles
of the Sphere, and what they are, and their vses: and also the
names of other things belonging therevnto, and what they are,
and their vses.

<section type="definitions">
<wordgroup1 type="t">
First what the Horizon circle is.

<wordentry type="d"><form lexeme="horizon(n)">THe Horizon </form> <xpln>is the parting of the earthe or the
Sea and the skye, that is to say, the halfe of the
heauens beeing aboue ouer your heade, and the o&#173;
ther halfe hidden with the earth or Sea vnder
them: and this Horizon circle dothe moue as you doe moue:
for as you doe by trauell chaunge your place, so doth the Ho&#173;
rizon chaunge in all points. 

The vse of the Horizon circle.

THe vse of the Horizon circle is this, to take the heigth
of the Sunne or any starre, with the crosse staffe, setting
the one ende with the Horizon, and the other ende with the
Sunne or starre, so that you haue a true Horizon: and that
must be doone vpon the Sea, or else it must be a very playne
grounde vpon the toppe of a bill, else it is no true Horizon,
And also if the Sunne or Moone, or any starre be to be seene,
th<expan type="">en</expan> they be aboue the Horizon: if they be not to be seene, then
they be vnder the Horizon.</xpln></wordentry>

2. What the Meridian circle is.

<wordentry type="d"><form lexeme="meridian(n)">THe Meridian </form> <xpln>is a circle beginning due South, and so
passing by youre Zenith that is right ouer the crowne

</page>

<page sig="a1v">
of your head, and so by the two Poles of the worlde: and if
you doe trauell due South and North, you doe not chaunge
youre Meridian: but in the going or trauelling any other
way, you do chaunge it.

The vse of the Meridian circle.

THe vse of the Meridian circle is, to knowe the iust tyme
of noone by the Sunne: for as soone as the middle
of the Sunne is vpon the Meridian, then it is noone, and
when the Sunne, Moone, or any Star is vpon the Meridian,
then they be farthest from the Horizon, and it is a meete time
to take their heigth for to know the altitude or heigth of the
Pole of the worlde, whereby you may perfitly knowe howe
farre you bee too the Southwardes or Northwardes of
any place.</xpln></wordentry>

3. <wordentry type="d"><form lexeme="equinoctial circle(n)">What the Equinoctiall circle </form> <xpln>is, being
a Paralell line or circle fixed.

THe Equinoctiall is a fixed circle in the Heauens equally
distant from both the Poles, and doth passe directly ouer
the middle of the earth rounde about, and is called the Equi&#173;
noctiall, for that if the Sunne be there, then thorowe all the
whole world the Sunne is twelue houres aboue the Hori&#173;
zon, and twelue houres vnder the Horizon sauing vnder the
two Poles, and there the Equinoctiall is with the Horizon.
So they shal see half the Sunne and no more, till the Sunne
be departed from the Equinoctiall. And also to them that do
inhabite or dwell in any place vnder the Equinoctiall, the
Sunne, Moone, and all the Starres be twelue hours aboue 
the Horizon, and twelue houres vnder the Horizon.

The vse of the Equinoctiall circle.

THe vse of the Equinoctiall, is to knowe what declination
the Sunne or any other Starre hath from it, and of whi&#173;
che side, and by that is known the heigth of the Equinoctial,

</page>

<page sig="a2r">
and by the heigth of that is known the heigth of either of the
two Poles of the world.</xpln></wordentry>

4 <wordentry type="d"><form lexeme="Tropic of Cancer(n)">WHat the circle of Tropicke of Cancer </form> <xpln>is,
being a Paralell circle fixed.

THe Tropicke of Cancer is the greatest declination that
the Sunne doth come vnto the Northwards, and then is
our longest Sommer dayes, and shortest nights.</xpln></wordentry>

5. <wordentry type="d"><form lexeme="tropic of Capricorn(n)">What the circle or Tropick of Capricorne </form> <xpln>is,
being a Paralell circle fixed.

THe Tropicke of Capricorne, is the greatest declination
that the sunne doth go vnto the Southwards, and then is
our shortest Winter dayes, and longest nights.

The vses of these two circles be but smal, but that the days
beeing at the longest or shortest, the Sunne dothe returne
backe againe. &#38;c.</xpln></wordentry>

6. <wordentry type="d"><form lexeme="Arctic circle(n)">What the Articke circle </form> <xpln>is, beeing a Paralell circle.

THe Articke circle doth touch the Horizon due North, and
is according to the place that you are in, of any place vp&#173;
on the face of the earth, and doth wyden and narrow accor&#173;
ding vnto the altitude or heigth of the Pole: for as you doe
goe vnto the South partes, then dothe your Articke circle
growe narower and narower, vntill you come right vnder
the Equinoctiall line, and then haue you no Articke circle:
and if that you do goe vnto the North partes, then doth your
Articke circle growe wider and wider: and where the
North Pole is raysed .66. degrees and a half, there the Artick
circle is iust with the Tropick of Cancer, and then vnder the
north Pole, there your Artick circle is with the Equinoctial.

The vse of the Articke circle.

THe vse of the Articke circle, is to knowe what Starres
doe neuer set vntoo you, for all those Starres or lyghtes
that you doe see vnder the Pole, doe not set: and if that you
bee vnto the North wardes, of the height of the Pole, more

</page>

<page sig="a2v">
than. 66. degrees and a halfe: if that the Sunne or Moone
be in the Tropick of Cancer, they shall not goe downe vnto
you vnder the Horizon, but shall b&#233;e still in sighte vntoo
you, so that they be not let by the cloudes and other acci&#173;
dentes.</xpln></wordentry>

7. <wordentry type="d"><form lexeme="Antarctic circle(n)">What the Antarticke circle </form> <xpln>is, beeing a
Paralell circle.

THe Antarticke circle doth touch the Horizon due South,
and is opposite or right agaynste the Articke circle, and
bothe wyde and narrowe in all poyntes, and dothe not differ
from the Articke circle, sauing the Articke circle is aboue
the Horizon, and the Antarticke circle is vnderneath the
Horizon.

The vse of the Antarticke circle.

THe vse of the Antarticke circle is as the Articke is in all
poyntes, to knowe what starres will not appeare aboue
your Horizon, and in like manner, to the Northwardes of
66. degrees and a halfe, (the Sunne or Moone being in the
Tropicke of Capricorne) then they wyll not ryse aboue the
Horizon.</xpln></wordentry>

8. <wordentry type="d"><form lexeme="Zodiac(n)">What the Zodiacke </form> <xpln>is, beeing a circle.

THe Zodiacke is the greatest circle in all the Heauens,
wherein all the wandering lightes or Planets doe keepe
theyr courses, that is to say, the Sunne and Moone, and the
other fiue Planets or Starres, that is to say, Saturne, Iupi&#173;
ter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury. &#38;c whiche circle is deuided in&#173;
to twelue equall partes, called the twelue <emend err="singes">signes</emend>, as Aries,
Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagita&#173;

oblique equinoctiall or awrye, crossing in the middle at two
places: the Northermost parte is the middle of the Zodi&#173;
acke, and that is the Tropicke of Cancer: and the Souther&#173;

</page>

<page sig="a3r">
most parte is the tropicke of Capricorne, the very midle of
the zodiack: and that line in the midle of the zodiack, is cal&#173;
led the ecliptick lyne, and the zodiack is .2. degrees broade,
that is to say, sixe degrees from the eclipticke line vnto the
north parts, and sixe degrees vnto the South parts.

The vse of the Zodiack.

THe vse of the Zodiacke is, through the mouing of the
Sunne and Moone &#38; the other planets, to know in what
signe they be, and also to know the time of the chaunge of the
Moone, with all the other respects: and in like manner to
know the aspects of all the other planets vnto the Moone, and
the .12. signes is gathered their effects, and in what countrey
it may happen.</xpln></wordentry>

<wordentry type="d"><form lexeme="ecliptic line(n)">THe line ecliptick, </form> <xpln>is a circle in the very middle of the Zo&#173;
diack, the whiche the very midle or center of the Sunne
doth go vpon.

The vse of the line Ecliptick.

THe vse of the line Ecliptick is this, if that the Moone or
any other starre be vnto the North part therof, then it is
sayd that they haue North latitude, and if vnto the Southe
part, then they haue south latitude: and also by this circle cal&#173;
led the line ecliptick, is knowne the eclipse of the Sunne
and the Moone.</xpln></wordentry>

first point of Aries and Libra, and so passeth by the .2. poles of
the world, and is called the equinoctiall colure: and the other
colure circle doth crosse the Zodiacke in the firste pointe of
Cancer and Capricorne, and so passeth the .2. poles of the
world, and there at the .2. poles the one circle doth crosse the
other: and that is called the Solstitiall colure.

The vse of these two circles.

THe vse of the. 2. colure circles is this, the Sunne placing

gainst the other: the North pole alwayes aboue our horizon,
and the South pole antartick always vnder our horizon, be&#173;
ing fixed fast in the heauens, and the equinoctiall iust and
equally betw&#233;ene them: and the cause why that it is imagi&#173;
ned to bee an axiltree is thys, for that the whole hea&#173;
uens and all the lyghtes of the Firmamente be caried
rounde aboute from the East vnto the West in. 24. houres:

suche forme as the meridian lynes do all m&#233;ete at the
poles of the world, and so do all those diuisions meete at the

charge of Shippes in Nauigation.

AS touching those persons that are m&#233;ete to take charge,
that is to say, </form> <xpln> to be as maister of ships in Nauigation, he
ought to be sober and wise, and not to be light or rash headed,
nor to be to fumish or hasty, but such a one as can wel gouern
himselfe, for else it is not possible for him to gouerne his c<expan type="">om</expan>&#173;
pany well: he ought not to be to simple, but he must be suche
a one as must k&#233;epe his companie in awe of him (by discre&#173;
tion,) doing his companie no iniurie or wrong, but to let th<expan type="">em</expan>
haue that whiche men ought to haue, and then to see vnto
them that they doe their laboure as men ought to doe in all
points. And the principall point in gouernment is, to cause
himself both to be feared &#38; loued, &#38; that groweth principal&#173;
ly by this meanes, to cherishe men in well doing, and those
men that be honestly addicted, to let them haue reasonable
preheminence, so that it be not hurtfull vnto the Marchaunt
nor to himselfe, and to punishe those that be malefactors and
disturbers of their company, and for smal faults, to giue them
gentle admonition to amende them: and principally these
two pointes are to be foreseene by the maisters, (that is) to
serue God himselfe, and to see that all the whole companie
do so in like maner, at suche conuenient time as it is m&#233;ete
to be done: the second point is, that the master vse no play at
the dise or cards, neither (as near as he c<expan type="">an</expan> to suffer any, for <expan type="">the</expan>
sufferance therof may do very much hurt in diuers respects:
And furthermore, the maister ought to be suche a one, as

what time it is a full Sea, or a lowe water, knowing in
what quarter or part of the skye, that the Moone doth make
a full Sea at that place, and also the master ought to b&#233;e ac&#173;
quainted, or knowe that place well, that he doth take charge
to goe vnto (except that he haue a Pilot) and also he that ta&#173;
keth charge vpon him, ought to be expert, how the tydegates
or currentes doe set from place vnto place: and also not to
b&#233;e ignorant of such daungers as lyeth by the way, as rocks,
sandes, or bankes, and also most principally he ought to b&#233;e
suche a one, as can very well directe his courses vnto any
place assigned, and to haue capacitie howe for to handle or
shift himselfe in foule weather or stormes. And also it beho&#173;
ueth him too be a good coaster, that is to say, to knowe euery
place by the sight thereof. And also he that taketh charge for
long voyages, ought to haue knowledge in plats or cardes,
and also in such instruments as be meet to take the heigth of
the Sunne or any Starre, and to haue capacitie to correcte
those instrumentes, and also he ought to be suche a one, that
can calculate the Sunnes declination, or else to haue some
true regiment, and also he ought to knowe howe to handle
the Sunnes declination, when that he hath taken the heigth
of the Sunne.</xpln></wordentry>
