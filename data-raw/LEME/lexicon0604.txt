It is call'd <f type="i">Sower, Bitter,</f> and <f type="i">Stinking,</f>
when in smelling to it, or taking the water
in which it has soaked, we perceive it <f type="i">Sowr
bitter</f> or <f type="i">stinking.</f>

It is called White <f type="i">Clay,</f> when it is of a
White stiff, and slimy substance, and is
fat, heavy, gross and Cold, and cuts like
Butter, and is very apt to chop with the
<f type="i">Summers</f> heat; and some call it dead Earth
because of its unfruitfulness.

It is stiled good when we can make any
thing grow in we have a mind to; And
bad when neither <f type="i">Trees,</f> Plants nor Seeds
thrive in it.

It is called hot and burning, when it is
so light and dry that upon the least heat,
all the Plants in it dry away and wither.

It is called <f type="i">Gravelled</f> when 'tis mixed
with much sand and many little stones tem<emend err="">&shy;</emend>
pered with a little light Red <f type="i">Clay.</f>

It is called <f type="i">Tough,</f> heavy, and by some
stubborn, and because of its unfruitfulness
Chast, and in <f type="i">England</f> Red, Loamy stiff
<f type="i">Clay,</f> when it cuts smooth and stiff, and is
very hard to Till or dress, because the great
rains beat it all into a marsh like mortar,
and the heat on the other side chops it,
and makes it hard as a stone.

It is called strong, free, or rank Earth,
when without being stiff and Clayie, it is
like the bottom or mould under the turf,
of good medow Ground, and in handling,
sticks to the fingers like a paste, and receives
any shape or impression from them, whe&shy;
ther long, round, <f type="i">&amp;c.</f>

It is termed Cold, moist, and backward
when upon the advance of the <f type="i">Spring</f> it is
long before it conceives heat enough to put
forth its productions, and brings forth eve&shy;
ry thing later than other places.

It is called forward, or hasty, when
<f type="i">Fruits</f> ripen in it betimes; as at St. <f type="i">Ger&shy;
mains Paris,</f> St. <f type="i">Maur,</f> &amp;c. and back&shy;
ward when it has a contrary effect.

It is called loose, light and mellow, when
either by art or nature it is brought to a
midling consistence, that is, loose and light
like sand, and yet partaking of the heart
and substance of good mould, easily obeying
the spade, rake and other instruments, and
penetrable to Seeds and the shoots and Fi&shy;
brous Roots of Plants and <f type="i">Trees.</f>

It is called new or fresh when it never
served yet to the production of any Plant,
such as is found two or three foot or more
in depth beyond the surface or upper crust
of the Ground.

It is called made or transported Earth
when 'tis brought into the <f type="i">Garden</f> from
some other place.

It is called Fallow Ground when 'tis laid
to rest a year or two or more, without being
planted or sown with any thing. See hol&shy;
low.

It is called over wrought or exhausted
Ground, when it has been a long time con&shy;
tinually tilled, sown and Planted without
intermission, and without any recruit or
amendment.

Lastly it is called light and sandy when
without having any body of true Earth, its
parts do not stick together, no not with
the Rain it self, but are so loose, that no
plants can take hold enough to fix any
Root there.</xpln></wordentry>

<f type="i">What things should be planted in any</f> Kitchen-Garden <f type="i">of a reasonable extent,
to render it compleatly furnished.</f>

ALL the World is agreed, that there are few days in the whole Year in which
we can be well without the assistance of the <f type="i">Kitchen-Gardens,</f> whether it be in
the fair and fruitful Season, whilst they are still growing on the Earth that first pro&shy;
duced them, when we have no more to do but to go and gather them there; or in
<f type="i">Winter</f> when we must fetch them out of the Store-rooms, where we had timely laid them
up for Security, before the arrival of the bitter cold, which not only makes the Earth
unfruitful for a time, but destroys too a great part of those Vegetables which are so un&shy;
happy as to be within its reach; and therefore it follows, that every day of the Year,
we must be furnisht with what we need of this Nature, out of our own Gardens or
Stores, or elsewhere, either by the liberality of our Friends, or what is most common
from the Markets.

That you may therefore have at one view, the knowledge of what composes this a&shy;
greeable assistance, that may be drawn out of the <f type="i">Kitchen-Garden.</f> I shall here present
you with a kind of <f type="i">Alphabetical Inventory</f> of all the things that such a Garden should,
and may furnish us with, throughout the whole course of the year.

and parted from the next Bed by a path-way of one full foot; these Trenches of
Pits are to be made at about half a foots distance from the edge of the Bed, and
Checquerwise one towards the other; we place two Slips in a right Line in each
space containing between Nine and Ten Inches in Length. We must renew them
once every three years at least, cut off their Leaves at the beginning of Win&shy;
ter, and cover them with long dry dung during all the very cold weather till the
end of <f type="i">March,</f> when we must uncover them, and slip them, if their Slips be yet big e&shy;
nough, or else stay three Weeks or a Month longer till they be, then we must labour
and move the Earth well about them, and dung them with the rottenest part of that
Dung that served them for a covering; we water them moderately once or twice a Week,
till about the end of <f type="i">May,</f> their Fruit begins to appear, and from that time we must wa&shy;
ter them plentifully, that is two or three times a Week, during the whole Summer, al&shy;
lowing half a Pitcher full of Water to each plant, and especially in Grounds naturally
dry; those planted in the Spring, should bring their Fruit to perfection in Autumn fol&shy;
lowing, if well watered, and they which do not, ought to yield their first Fruit in the
next Spring after, in case they be strong enough to resist the sharpness of the Winter.
<f type="i">Artichokes</f> have not only the hard weather, and excess of wet to fear, but they have the
Field Mice likewise for their Enemies, those mischievous little Animals gnawing their
Roots in the Winter-time, when they find nothing better in the Gardens, and for that

<page sig="bb2r">
reason, it's good to plant one Rank of <f type="i">Beet-Chards</f> between two Ranks of <f type="i">Artichokes,</f>
that the Field-Mice finding the Roots of these last the tendrer of the two, may fall up&shy;
on them instead of the others, as they never fail to do. There are three sorts of <f type="i">Arti&shy;
chokes, viz.</f> the green, or otherwise white ones, which are the most early, the violet
ones, whose Fruit is almost of a pyramidal Figure, and the red ones which are round,
and flat like the white ones. The two last sorts are the most delicious. </xpln></wordentry>

<wordentry type="h"><form lang="en" lexeme="asparagus(n)"><f type="i">Asparagus</f></form> <xpln lang="en">are sown at the beginning of the Spring like other Seeds, that is, they are
sown in some Bed well prepared; they must be sown indifferent thin, and raked with an
Iron Rake, to cover them with Earth. About a year after, if they be big enough, as
they will be, if the Ground be good, and well prepared; or if not, at least at two years
end, we must <emend err="tranplant">transplant</emend> them, which is to be done about the end of <f type="i">March,</f> and all the
Month of <f type="i">April;</f> and for that effect we must have Beds between three and four foot
broad, and separated one from the other; if it be in ordinary Ground, we dig these Beds
hollow with a good Spade, throwing up the Earth we take out of them upon the
Path-ways; and as to strong, heavy and moist Grounds, I would have them ordered
as I have done the <f type="i">Kitchen-Garden</f> at <f type="i">Versailles,</f> that is to say, I would not have the Beds in
them at all laid hollow, but on the contrary, raised and kept higher than the Path-ways,
too much wet being mortal to these Plants. <f type="i">Asparagus</f> thus sown shoot out Tufts of Roots
round about their Eye, or Mother Root; that is to say, round the place from whence all
their shoots are to Spring, which Roots spread between two Earths, and in order to
transplant them either into a hollow Bed, or a high raised Bed, we bestow a good tho&shy;
rough Tillage on the bottom of the Trench, and if the Ground be not very good, we
dung it a little, and afterward we plant two or three stocks of these young Plants, or&shy;
derly in ranks upon the Superficies of the Bed prepared for them, without needing to
trim the extremity of their Roots, or at least, but a very little, and if our intention be,
to force these <f type="i">Asparagus</f> by an artificial heat, when they are grown big enough, we place
them at a foot distance one from the other, and if they be to remain to grow after the
usual manner, we allow them at a foot and a half's distance, but in both Cases, we
place them Checquerwise, and when they are so placed, we cover them up again with
two or three Inches depth of Earth: if any of them fail to Spring up, we may reimplace
them with new ones two or three Months after, which is to be done in the same man&shy;
ner as we planted the others, only taking care to water the new planted ones sometimes
during the great heat, and to keep them always well weeded, and well dug about, or
else we mark out with little sticks the empty places, and stay till the Spring before
we fill them up again. Every year we cover the Bed with a little Earth taken off from
the Path-way, because instead of sinking, they always are rising by little and little: we
dung them moderately every two years, and let them shoot up the first three or four
years without gathering any, till we see them begin to grow pretty thick, and then we
may force as many as we please of them, or if not, we continue to gather of them every
year a crop for fifteen years, before we need to renew them. Every year about <f type="i">Martle&shy;
mas,</f> we cut down all their stems, every stock producing several stems, and take the seed
of the fairest of them for Seed, if we would have them come to bear at the time above-&shy;
mentioned. To draw them out of their <f type="i">Nursery-Beds,</f> we use an Iron Fork, the <f type="i">Spade</f> be&shy;
ing too dangerous for that work, because it would cut, and hurt those little
Plants.

We must not fail every Year at the latter end of <f type="i">March,</f> or beginning of <f type="i">April,</f>
that is, before the <f type="i">Asparagus</f> begin to sprout naturally, to bestow a small dressing or
stirring of the Ground about three or four Inches deep, on every Bed, taking care not
to let the <f type="i">Spade</f> go so deep, as to hurt the Plants; which small dressing serves, both to
kill the Weeds and to render the Superficies of the Earth loose, and thereby not only the
better to dispose it to drink up the Rain, and the <f type="i">May-dew</f> that nourishes the Stocks, but
likewise to facilitate the passage of the <f type="i">Asparagus</f> in sprouting. The particular and most
dreadful Enemies of <f type="i">Asparagus</f> are a sort of little Fleas, that fasten upon their shoots,
make them miscarry, and hinder them from thriving; they are most troublesome in ve&shy;
ry hot and dry years, not appearing at all in other years; there has been no Remedy
found yet against this mischief.</xpln></wordentry>

form their heads, they must be covered with their Leaves tied up for that end over
them, with Straw bands, to guard them from the insults of the Cold that spoil and rot
them. They are for our <f type="i">Winter</f> spending, and must be sheltred in the <f type="i">Green</f> house or

rots, Parsnips, Cellery,</f> &amp;c. must be supported either with upright props, or cross
sticks, to hinder the wind from breaking down their stems before the Seed be
Ripe.

The second is, that we seldom stay to let any Seeds dry upon their Plants as they
stand, it being enough to let them only Ripen, when we cut down their stems, and lay
them to dry upon some Cloth, after which, we beat them out, and fan and cleanse them
and lay them up when they are fully dry: And thus we do with the Seeds of <f type="i">Cresses,

And if in fifteen or twenty days we do not see the Seed come up, we should uncover
them, to see whether they be rotten, or begin to sprout, that so we may fill up their
places with new ones in case of need. The Seeds of the first sowing are generally
three weeks coming up, and those of the second fifteen days. <f type="i">Cardons</f> must not be sown

it so much the longer, because that which has been long sown, easily runs to Seed, and
grows hard. We sow it then the first time upon <f type="i">Hot Beds</f> in the beginning of <f type="i">April,</f>
and because its Seed is so extream small, we cannot help sowing it too thick, so that if
we be not careful to thin it, and crop it in time, to make it grow to some strength and
bigness before we transplant it, it warps and flags its head too much, and grows weak,
and shoots its Leaves straglingly outward, instead of producing store of them from the
middle of its stock. The surest way is to transplant it in a <f type="i">Nursery Bed,</f> placing the
Plants two or three Inches one from another, for which we make holes with our fingers
only; we transplant that which comes of the first sowing at the beginning of <f type="i">June,</f>

the <f type="i">Green</f> sort which is the most rustical, and best able to resist the <f type="i">Cold,</f> as likewise the
Curled sort, and that which is not Curled.

All sorts of them agree tolerably well with all kinds of Ground. We seldom begin to

or be very much thinned, <emend err="aftewards">afterwards</emend> in order to be whitened in the places where they

because they are too apt to run to Seed: The season for sowing a greater quantity of

some good for spending in <f type="i">September,</f> and we afterwards sow a great deal of it again in

pull up some of it, to thin it, that the rest may grow big enough to be transplanted;
and when we transplant any of it in <f type="i">Summer</f> time, it must be placed at the distance of a
large foot between Plant and Plant; we usually make great <f type="i">Beds</f> of five or six foot
broad, in order to transplant them afterwards in rows markt out strait with a cord. This
Plant requires great and frequent waterings; and when 'tis big enough we must go to
work to whiten it, for which effect, we tie it up with two or three bands according as
its height requires; and being so tied, it whitens in fifteen, or twenty days: But because
it is very apprehensive of the <f type="i">Frost,</f> therefore assoon as ever the <f type="i">Cold</f> begins to come on,
we cover it with long dry Dung, whether it be tied up or no: At the end of <f type="i">September,</f>
we plant the stocks of it pretty near together because then it grows neither so high,
nor spreads so much as in <f type="i">Summer:</f> And if we can save any Plants of it in <f type="i">Winter,</f> we
must transplant them again in the <f type="i">Spring</f> in order to produce Seed that may have sufficient

There are some People that will eat it <f type="i">Green</f> in <f type="i">Sallets</f> though it be never so bitter, but

it been forced to spring up in obscurity, and shaded from all light, its young shoots

to stop up passages on all sides, that no light or Air at all get in. Being thus ordered,

Gardens,</f> and are indeed the most useful <f type="i">Manna</f> of them, and especially for <f type="i">Sallets,</f> of
which almost all the World is most constantly amorous. We have many things; for in
the first place, there are <f type="i">Lettuces</f> of different Seasons, those which are good in certain Months
in the year being not good in others; and those which grow well in the <f type="i">Spring,</f> thriving
not well in <f type="i">Summer;</f> and they which prosper in <f type="i">Autumn</f> and <f type="i">Winter,</f> coming <emend err="tonothing">to nothing</emend>, nei&shy;
ther in <f type="i">Spring</f> nor <f type="i">Summer,</f> as will be seen afterwards: In the second place, there are some
that with the ordinary help of the general culture attain their due perfection, and contri&shy;
bute both to the nourishment and pleasure of Man-kind, and they are the <f type="i">Cabbage Lettuces.</f>
</page>

<page sig="cc2r">
Thirdly, there are some that necessarily require the Art of Industry and the Gard'ner to
advance them to that degree of perfection which they should have; and they are such
as must be tied up to make them grow white, without which they would be neither
tender, nor sweet, nor good; such as are the <f type="i">Roman Lettuces,</f> &amp;c. Nay, and I have
thought fit sometimes to tie up those that were to cabbage, when I saw they did not cab&shy;
bage soon enough, by which means they may be forced to cabbage whether they will
or no. I use this Method particularly with some sorts of <f type="i">Winter Lettuces,</f> that is, when
there are any of them which though furnished with leaves big enough to cabbage,
yet for want of sufficient heat, are hindred from turning, that is from growing hard;
and this expedient is a very soveraign Remedy against that Defect, in a surly Season; and
besides these general distinctions, the number of the particular Kinds of <f type="i">Lettuces</f> is
greater than of any other sort of <f type="i">Kitchen-plants</f> whatsoever, as will appear more especially
by the order they observe in respect of the Seasons; and the order of the <f type="i">Cabbage-Lettuces,</f>
as near as I can describe it, is this.

The first that cabbage at the going out of Winter, are the <f type="i">Shell Lettuces</f> so call'd,
because their Leaf is round almost like a Shell. They are otherwise called <f type="i">Winter-Lettu&shy;
ces,</f> because they pretty well indure ordinary Frosts, which none of all the other <f type="i">Lettu&shy;
ces</f> can do. These are sown in <f type="i">September,</f> and afterward transplanted in some <f type="i">Wall-Border</f>
towards the South and East, in the Months of <f type="i">October</f> and <f type="i">November,</f> or else they are
sown upon <f type="i">Hot Beds</f> under <f type="i">Bells,</f> in the Months of <f type="i">February</f> and <f type="i">March,</f> and are good to
eat in <f type="i">April</f> and <f type="i">May.</f> We have at the same time another sort of <f type="i">Reddish Lettuces</f> called
<f type="i">Passion Lettuces,</f> which prosper very well in light Grounds, but not over well in others
that being colder and stronger or heavier, easily infect them with slimy Snivel. Both
these kinds should when they thrive, produce very thick and good Heads. To these
succeed the Bright curled <f type="i">Lettuces,</f> which usually cabbage in the Spring, that is before
the heat grows any thing excessive, but they must not be planted in strong and heavy Lands.
They likewise do well enough upon a <f type="i">Hot Bed,</f> and especially under <f type="i">Glass Bells</f> or <f type="i">Frames;</f>
for when they are sown in <f type="i">January,</f> and transplanted as soon as they are grown any thing
thick, or else left thin upon their <f type="i">Nursery-Beds,</f> they cabbage as soon as the <f type="i">Winter-Let&shy;
tuces,</f> and are very excellent.

There is about the same Season, two other sorts of <f type="i">Curled Bright Lettuces;</f> viz. one called
<f type="i">George Lettuces,</f> which are thicker and less curled than the ordinary <f type="i">Curled Bright Lettuces;</f>
and another called the <f type="i">Minion Lettuce,</f> which is the least sort. Both these last require such
Ground as we term good black Sand, but yet their Heads seldom cabbage close enough,
that is to say, are not ordinarily so hard and firm as those of the right <f type="i">Curled Bright Let&shy;
tuces.</f>

The <f type="i">Curled Green Lettuces</f> come in near about the same Season with the preceeding ones,
but are not so tender nor delicate.

There is also a sort of small red ones, and another named <f type="i">Short Lettuces,</f> both which
have all the necessary qualifications of good <f type="i">Lettuces,</f> excepting only that their
Heads are small, and that they likewise require Black Sandy Ground.

The first <f type="i">Lettuces</f> supply us amply as I have said, during the Months of <f type="i">April</f> and
<f type="i">May,</f> and the beginning of <f type="i">June,</f> but after that time they are too apt to be influenced
to run to Seed by the great heat that then comes on. They are followed during the
rest of <f type="i">June,</f> and all the Month of <f type="i">July,</f> by those called the <f type="i">Royal Bellegardes,</f> or <f type="i">Fair
Looks, Bright Genua's, Capucins, Aubervilliers,</f> and <f type="i">Perpignans;</f> of which last, there are both
green and bright, both of which produce very fair and very good heads, and thrive well
enough in strong Grounds too, when the Summer proves not too Rainy; but cold, or
too frequent Rains infect them with Slime and Snivel, and consequently destroy them. The
<f type="i">Capucin Lettuces</f> are reddish, cabbage easily, even without transplanting, and are pretty
delicate. The <f type="i">Aubervilliers</f> bring forth Heads that are too hard, and sometimes bitter
withall, and are more used for boiling than for Sallets. The difference that appears
between the <f type="i">Royal</f> and the <f type="i">Bellegardes</f> or <f type="i">Fair look'd Lettuces,</f> is only, that the former are a
little more Greenish, and these last a little Brighter.

However in the Summer time, the tied <f type="i">Lettuces</f> are mixed among the cabbaged ones,
<f type="i">viz.</f> the <f type="i">Roman Lettuces</f> which are open, and are called <f type="i">Chicons,</f> or <f type="i">Bright,</f> and are termed <f type="i">Al&shy;
phanges,</f> which last are more delicate than the <f type="i">Chicons,</f> both to raise, and when they are
eaten in <f type="i">Sallets.</f> There are also a sort which are stiled <f type="i">Imperial Lettuces,</f> which are of an ex&shy;
traordinary great Size, and are likewise very delicate to the taste, but very apt to rot
as soon as ever they grow white; there are besides, a certain kind of large <f type="i">Reddish Chi&shy;
cons,</f> which whiten in a manner of themselves without tying, and are good in course
Grounds, and succeed usually pretty well in Summer, for as for the green <f type="i">Chicons,</f> we
</page>

<page sig="cc2v">
cannot well have them but in the Spring, because they run too hastily to Seed. The
<f type="i">Lettuces</f> that defend themselves best from the great heat that predominates about the end
of <f type="i">July,</f> and all the Month of <f type="i">August,</f> are those we call <f type="i">Genua Lettuces,</f> and especially
the green sort, for the <f type="i">Bright Genua,</f> and <f type="i">Red Genua</f> run more easily to Seed, and will
hardly come to good but in light Grounds. We should therefore prepare a great many
of these green <f type="i">Genua's</f> against the Dog-days, and the first Frosts; we may also intermix
with them some few <f type="i">Bright,</f> and some <f type="i">Red Genua's;</f> but more especially we should
be sure to mix with them some <f type="i">Alfanges,</f> and a great quantity of bright or white <f type="i">Endive,</f>
as likewise, a great many <f type="i">Perpignan Lettuces,</f> both of the bright and green kind. The
great Inconveniencies that happen to <f type="i">Cabbage Lettuces,</f> are first, that they often degene&shy;
rate so far as to cabbage no more, which is discovered by their Leaves growing out in
length like a Cat's Tongue, as Gard'ners term it, or by their changing their natural
colour into another more or less green; and therefore we must be very careful to gather
no Seed from any but such as cabbage very well, for which effect, we should be sure
to mark out at first, some of those that turn best, in order to reserve them to run to
Seed where they stand, or to remove them with a turf of the Earth about them into some
separate place assigned for that purpose.

The second is, that as soon as the most part of them are cabbaged, they must be
spent, unless we would have the displeasure to see them run to Seed without doing us a&shy;
ny Service; in which Respect the Market Gard'ners have a great advantage beyond o&shy;
ther Persons, because they can sell off in one day, whole Beds of these <f type="i">Cabbage Lettuces,</f>
for commonly the Beds which were new planted at the same time, <f type="i">Cabbage</f> likewise all
at once, whereas in other Gardens, we cannot spend them any faster than we need them,
for which Reason we are obliged to plant often of them, and that in greater quantity
than we are able to consume, that we may have a continual supply of them successively,
without any Discontinuation, it being much more commodious to have an over-plus
quantity of them, than to want. The surest way is to keep particularly to those sorts
that are the most Rustical, and that last a great while cabbaged before they run to
Seed, such as are the <f type="i">Shell Lettuces,</f> the <f type="i">Perpignans,</f> the <f type="i">Green Genua's,</f> the <f type="i">Aubervilliers,</f>
and the <f type="i">Austrichettes,</f> or <f type="i">Austrian Lettuces,</f> which I must confess too, are a long time cab&shy;
baging.

The third inconvenience is, that the <f type="i"><term lang="fr">Morie</term>,</f> that is, the Rot which begins at
the ends of their Leaves, seizes them sometimes, and that when the Ground or the Sea&shy;
son are not favourable to them, they remain thin and lean, and run up to Seed instead
of spreading and cabbaging. There is hardly any Remedy to prevent this Rot be&shy;
cause there is hardly any to be found effectual against the cold and rainy Seasons that
cause it; but against the defects that may be in the Ground, there are infallible ones, that
is to say, it must be amended and improved with small Dung, if it be barren, whether it
be a sandy, or a <f type="i">Cold</f> and gross Earth; and to this last, we should give a little slope,
if when the Ground is good, the waters spoil it by settling too much in it, and by that
means, make all the Plants growing there to rot. Good Dung throughly rotten, be&shy;
ing the Soul and <f type="i"><term lang="la">Primum Mobile</term></f> of <f type="i">Kitchen-Gardens,</f> without which, no more than
without frequent waterings, and dressing of the Ground no man can ever be rich in fine
and goodly <f type="i">Legumes.</f>

There yet remains to be known for the perfect understanding the ordering of <f type="i">Let&shy;
tuces,</f> that they which grow biggest must be placed ten or twelve inches one from the
other, which is to be understood of the <f type="i">Shell Lettuces, Perpignans, Austrians, Bellegardes,</f>
or <f type="i">Fair-looks, Aubervilliers, Alfanges,</f> and <f type="i">Imperials;</f> and for those that bear heads but of a
midling size, the distance of seven or eight inches is enough, which are the Bright Curled,
the short, the little <f type="i">Red,</f> and the <f type="i">Green Chicon Lettuces,</f> &amp;c. Those that will be good
husbands may sow <f type="i">Radishes</f> in their <f type="i">Lettuce Beds,</f> because the <f type="i">Radishes</f> will be all drawn
out and spent before the <f type="i">Lettuces</f> cabbage; and for the same reason, because the <f type="i">Endives</f>
are much longer before they come to perfection than the <f type="i">Lettuces,</f> we may Plant some of
these last among the <f type="i">Endives;</f> they agree well enough one with the other: and so we
may have a double crop to gather upon one and the same <f type="i">Bed</f> and in the same Season;
for the <f type="i">Lettuces</f> are gathered first, and afterwards the <f type="i">Endives</f> arrive to their full good&shy;
ness.</xpln><lemenote>"Austrian lettuce" and "Autrichettes" not found in OED. "George lettuce" antedates earliest OED citation (1706).</lemenote></wordentry>

nourishment that was before spent in their stems, being hindered from mounting upwards,
will remain and settle all in that which I think, is but improperly called their head, and

<f type="i">Sallets,</f> and sometimes in <f type="i">Pottages.</f> There are two sorts of it, <f type="i">viz.</f> The <f type="i">Green,</f> and the
<f type="i">Red,</f> or <f type="i">Golden;</f> this latter is the more agreeable of the two to the Eye, and more deli&shy;
cate and difficult to rear, so that in hard weather we have much ado to make it grow
even upon hot Beds, and under Bells, for it seldom prospers in open Beds till about the
middle of <f type="i">May,</f> and then too, the Earth must be very good, sweet, and very loose,
and the weather very fair. And therefore for our first <f type="i">Purslain</f> which we are not to
begin to sow upon hot Beds till towards the Middle of <f type="i">March,</f> we must use only the
Green sort, because the Yellow or Golden sort dwindles away as soon as 'tis come up, un&shy;
less the Season be a little advanced, and the Sun a little hot, which is, towards the end
of <f type="i">April.</f> It is commonly sown very thick, because its Seed is so very small, that it can&shy;
not be sown thin. When we sow it upon hot Beds, either when 'tis cold, and that
by consequence Glass-bells or Frames are needfull, or in milder Weather, we only press
down the Mold about it with our hands, or with the back of a Spade; but when we
sow it in open Beds which must be well prepared for that purpose, we rake it over
five or six times with an Iron Rake, to make the Seed enter into the Ground.

<emend err="They">The</emend> way to raise Seed from it, is to transplant some Plants of it that are big e&shy;
nough, into Beds well prepared, at the distance of eight or ten inches ones from the o&shy;
ther: The Months of <f type="i">June</f> and <f type="i">July</f> are proper for that effect. And then in a little
time after, they are run up, and have done flowring, assoon as ever we perceive any
of their Husks to open, and discover some black Seed, we must cut down all their
Stems and lay them some days in the Sun till all the Seed be quite ripened, and then we
beat them out and winnow them, <f type="i">&amp;c.</f> We must be carefull to transplant each sort a&shy;
part by it self, that we may not be mistaken in the Seed when we are to sow it. The
Stick Stalks of <f type="i">Purslain</f> that is run to Seed, are good to pickle in Salt and Vinegar, for
Winter Sallets.</xpln></wordentry>

<wordentry type="h"><form lang="en" lexeme="radish(n)">R<f type="i">Adishes,</f></form> <xpln lang="en">when they are qualified with all the goodness they should have, that is,
when they are tender, and snap easily, and are sweet, are in my Opinion, one of
the Plants that give the most pleasure of any in our <f type="i">Kitchin-gardens,</f> and that give it as
often, and for as long a time as any of them all; and I look upon them as a kind of
<f type="i">Manna</f> in our Gardens. There seems to be no great pains required to make them grow,
it being indeed only necessary to sow them pretty thin, in well prepared loose and mel&shy;
low Earth, and to water them soundly in drie Weather, and with this culture they
will attain to all the perfection they are capable of. But the main points here in Que&shy;
stion, are first, to be always provided with Seed of a good kind; and secondly, to take
order to have <f type="i">Radishes</f> without discontinuation, from the Month of <f type="i">February,</f> till the
coming in of the Frosts in the middle of <f type="i">November.</f> As for Seed of a good kind, know,
that is it that produces few Leaves, and a long red Root, for there are some that pro&shy;
duce a great many leaves and little Root; and when we are once provided with Seed
of a good kind, we must be extreme carefull to propagate it, that we never be without
a stock of it; for which effect, in the Month of <f type="i">April,</f> we must choose out among
those <f type="i">Radishes</f> that are come of the last years Seed, such, as I have said, which have the
fewest Leaves and the most Root, and reddest Necks, and transplant them quite whole
in some well prepared spot of Ground, a foot and a half a sunder: Being so transplanted,
they will run up, flower and yield Seed ripe enough to gather towards the end of <f type="i">July;</f>
and then we cut down their stems; and after they have been dried some days in the
Sun, we beat out the Seed, and winnow it, <f type="i">&amp;c.</f>

Those stocks of them that run up to Seed, shoot up their Branches to such a height,
and perpetuate their flowers so far as if they knew not where to stop; and therefore it is
good to pinch off these Branches to a reasonable length, that the first Podds may be the
better nourished.

But 'tis not enough to raise good Seed, we must likewise take order to be supplied
with good <f type="i">Radishes</f> for eight or nine Months in the year. The first that are eaten grow
on Hot-beds, the manner of raising which, I have explained in the Works of <f type="i">November;</f>
and by the means of those <f type="i">Hot Beds,</f> we may have some during the Months of <f type="i">Februa&shy;
</page>

<page sig="cc4v">
ry</f> <f type="i">March</f> and <f type="i">April;</f> otherwise we have none; and in order to have some all the other
Months, we must sow some among all manner of Seeds, they coming up so very quickly,
that we have time to gather off our <f type="i">Radishes</f> before they can do any harm to the other
Plants. <f type="i">Radishes</f> are extreamly apprehensive of the excessive heat in <f type="i">Summer,</f> which makes
them grow strong as they term it, that is, too biting, stringy, and sometimes very hard;
and therefore in that Season we would affect to sow them in very loose Mellow Ground,
where the Sun shines but little; and the best way should be, to make up along by the
sides of some <f type="i">Northern</f> Walls, a <f type="i">Bed</f> or two for that purpose, filled with mold to the depth
of a large foot and an half, and to sow our <f type="i">Radishes</f> there, and water them well. In
<f type="i">Spring</f> and <f type="i">Autumn,</f> when the Sun is not so <f type="i">Hot, Radishes</f> take well enough in open Ground,
and in the wide unsheltered Air.</xpln></wordentry>
