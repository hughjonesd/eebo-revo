AS in the two bookes before going (gentle Reader) my
mind and purpose was to set foorth vnto the learner,
how much the phrase of our daylie speech by well
ordering and deliuerie is graced with Figures and
other ornaments of Art, and to such end and pur&#173;
pose, haue I in the margent of euerie Epistle, di&#173;
rectlie against the places where they are vsed, quoted them to be seen.
I haue now for better supplement of the learners knowledge, determi&#173;
ned in this place to make a collection of them all, remembring with
my selfe, that vnto such as are vnexperienced in their particular appli&#173;
cations, they shall be but of verie slender moment in their quotations,
without also they may be instructed by example, how, where, and in
what tearmes, wordes or cariage, they are vsed, and wherein, and by
what conueyance their efficacies are explaned. For which cause, these
briefe instructions following, conteining, as in the title before going, a
demonstration of their true &#38; seueral qualities, properties and natures,
are to such ende deliuered: wherein my purpose is to omit nothing,
which in my poore opinion may seeme vnto this deuised Methode a&#173;
nie wayes furthering. And howbeit my selfe in the writing of these
collections, doe well consider the want I haue of other perfections,
whereby to ornifie the matter hereof, with examples correspondent,
yet shall it by such meanes appeare vnto all fauourers of science, what
will and desire I haue to deserue with the best, confessing (as by due
proofe I haue found) no speech to be accounted valuable or of weight,
that is not graced with these parts. Thus hauing at large expostulated
my true meaning herein, I commit the rest to your curteous censures,
and my selfe to your good opinions.

Yours, A. D.

Betweene a Trope and a Scheme the difference is, that the
Trope changeth the signification, as in these wordes Generation
of Vipers, meaning thereby homicides of their owne issue or an&#173;
tecessors, as the Viper deuoureth her owne broode. The Scheme
hath no change of signification, but retaineth the expresse mea&#38;
ning, as, Can so great anger be in heauenlie mindes? written of
Iuno in the <term lang="la">Aeneidos</term> of Virgill, whereas anger is indeede onelie
a humaine passion, yet without alteration is there allotted vnto
the heauenlie Gods. And of some there is helde in them small dif&#173;

ple of the first may bee that saying of Cicero of Catiline, in these

possessions to liue vppon, were it not honestie to requite him: If of a

him? Howe much more then to him that hath not alonelie done all
these, but farre more then these vnto thee, oughtest thou in the verie

Example of the seconde sort for diminution might bee this: What
is it that you propose vnto mee these small matters of vnkindnesse, as
that the man is ingratefull, that hee hath no good remembraunce of
courtesies, that there is in him not so much as an acknowledge&#173;
ment, which is a thing farre from requitall, these I must confesse are
iniuries to some, but vnto mee they are trifles, matters of no moment,
things not to bee reckoned of: what say you to him that betrayeth
his friend, seeketh his death that hath sought his life, worketh by all
possible meanes his ouerthrow, his destruction and vndoing? And
