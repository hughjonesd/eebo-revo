Hat-band, wrist-band, neck-band: to

back-yard adjoining to it. A Bandog, 
a Mastiff kept close, or tied up. A Ban&shy;
dore, or veil of a widow to bind over 
or cover her head and face. A Horse-&shy;
Bin, which in Kent is that apartment 
of a stable, where the chaff and cut 
meat is secured by a partition of boards. 
A Bin or Bing, a Safe, an Aumbry or 
Cupboard in a Buttery or Larder. The 
kiln of the furnace wherein they burn 
their Charcoal for the melting of met&shy;

the Cistern, into which they throw their 
crystallized Allom for the water to 
drain from it, is call'd a Bing at Whitby

In a Terrier, or description of the site

said to be adjacentes, lying or border&shy;

abuttantes, abutting or bounding. Which 
in old surveys they sometime expressed

appeal to the Law, to offer proof for
the claim of right, to proceed to an 
Assise or Trial, and stand to the verdict 
of a Jury. So, To arraine a writ of No&shy;
vel disseisin, i. e. To prefer such an
Action, and prosecute the issue of it. 
To arraign an Assise, i. e. To make plaint, 
to open the cause, and sue for justice. 
To arraign a Criminal, i. e. To indict 
and bring him to his trial. Dr. Cowel 
would derive this term from the French 
<term lang="fr">Arranger</term>, to dispose or set in order,
which conjecture is approved and justi&shy;
fied by the latter Editor of that Inter&shy;
preter. But the more learned Sir Hen.
Spelman refers it to the old French 
word <term lang="fr">Arramir</term>, to swear or take a so&shy;
lemn oath. As if Arramire Assisam were
to appeal to the oaths of witnesses, and 
to the verdict of a Jury. But indeed I 
rather think that Adramire was at first 
a contraction of <term lang="la">Ad arma ire</term>, because 
the old legal trial both for the title of 
estates and the charge of crimes, was 
by solemn combat or duel, when Arra&shy;
mire or Arramare was to alarm or call
the accused person to a decisive trial at 
Arms. And because the Champions 
were upon the first challenge to swear 
that they would put themselves on this 
military issue : and at the time and place
of combat were again to take formal 
oaths to observe the stated laws of the
Camp ; Therefore Arramire was to 
swear, but in a secondary sense, as so&shy;
lemn swearing did attend and relate to
their solemn fighting. When this bar&shy;
barous custom of determining a cause 
by arms and blood, was succeeded by the
more civilized way of Assise or Trial by 
Jury, temp. Hen. 2. then the word was
continued, when the method was alter'd, 
and <term lang="la">Arramire versus aliquem</term> was to 
</page>

<page sig="zzzz4r">
appeal for justice against a person, and 
to sue for the benefit of a public trial. 
And <term lang="la">Arramire reum</term> was to arraign a 
Criminal, and offer proof for the con&shy;
viction of him. ---- <term lang="la">Thomans Abbas de

No church legally consecrated without 
an allotment of manse and glebe, made 
generally by the Lord of the Mannor, 
who thereby became Advocate or Pa&shy;
tron of that Church, p. 222. So as the 
Lordship of the Mannor and Patronage 
of the Church were rarely in different 
hands, till Advousons were unhappily 
given to Religious Houses, p. 276. Du&shy;
ring a controversie for the right of Pa&shy;
tronage, the Diocesan presented to the 
Church <term lang="la">salvo jure utriusque</term>. So in a 
suit depending between William Earl 
of Sarum and the Abbat of Barlings, for
the Advouson of the Church of Midle&shy;
ton, p. 192. So Hugh Bishop of Linc.
presented to the Church of Godington,
in a dispute of title between Thomas 
de Camvill and the Abbess of Alveston,
p. 193. When two several persons 
presented their respective Clerk, an In&shy;
quisition was directed from the Arch&shy;
deacon to be executed within the pa&shy;
rish, and return'd into the Court, p. 346.
No such Inquisition, if the right were 
apparent, <term lang="la">Nulla inquisitione in hac parte 
capta, quia Domino constabat de jure pa&shy;
tronatus</term>, p. 507. When the King pre&shy;
sented a Clerk upon a false title, the 
Bishop instituted the other's clerk, but
with great deference to the King's pre&shy;
tended title, and obliging the Clerk so
instituted to an oath of resignation, if
the King's right should afterward ap&shy;
pear. <term lang="la">Post institiitionem suam pr&aelig;dictam

presented not within six months, there 
was a lapse to the Bishop, <term lang="la">Dicunt e&shy;
tiam quod tempus semestre nondum
elapsum est</term>, p. 351. The King and 
other Guardians presented in the right 
of Wards, p. 192, 193. When the right 
of Advouson was determin'd by Law, 
a Writ lay to the Bishop to admit the 
right Clerk, <term lang="la">Concessum est quod pr&aelig;&shy;

The Advouson of Churches in such

Capite, not to be given by the Lords to 
Religious or Charitable uses, without 
Inquisition <term lang="la">Ad quod dampnum</term>, and li&shy;

right of Advouson were in Courts Chri&shy;
stian, p. 642. To prevent ligitious suits 
for the title to Benefices, the Rural
Deans took an account of the names
and number of the Parish Churches
within their respective districts; what
the Christian name and Sirname of the 
several Incumbents, the time of their 
collation to such Benefices, by what
title they held them, whither by Insti&shy;

age they were, and in what Orders;
whither Beneficed in more than one 
Church; the name and quality of the 
Patrons; and the value of every Bene&shy;
fice by the last taxation. This Register
was distinctly transcrib'd, and a fair

transmitted to the Metropolitan in 
the next Provincial Council, p. 647.

As those who built and endowed a

If a free election were left to the Reli&shy;
gious, yet a Conge d'eslire or license of 
electing was first to be obtain'd from 
the Patron, or in his absence out of 
England, from the Seneschal or Steward 
of his Barony. So in the Nunnery of 
Stodley, the Founder Edmund Earl of 
Cornwall thus provided, <term lang="la">Nec est pr&aelig;&shy;

nage was in dispute, the religious ap&shy;
plied themselves to which they pleas'd 
of the contending parties: so the Monks 
of Notley ask'd license of electing their 
Abbat from the Lady Maud de Morti&shy;
mer, whom they presum'd to be their 
Patroness, tho' the Earl of Glocester 
claim'd that right, p. 314. The Patro&shy;
nage lapsed to the Lord of the Honour, 
if the family of the Founder was ex&shy;
tinct; So Edmund Earl of Cornwall 
became Patron of the Nunnery of Go&shy;
ring, by no other title, than as that 
House was situate within the Honour 
of Walingford, p. 329. On the death 
of the Prelate or Governour, the lands 
escheated to the Patron as Lord of the 
fee, and were to be compounded for by 
Relief, Heriot, and other burdens of 
Military service: unless their endow&shy;
ment was Frank-Almoin, or such right 
in the fee was expresly renounc'd: As

is when the Lord or tenant feeds it not

the Reformation, several disputes arose 
what dues were comprehended under
the title of Altaragium, which were
thus remarkably determin'd in a trial
in the Exechequer in Michaelmass term,
21. Eliz. on Thursday November 12. 
Upon the hearing of the matter betwixt
Ralph Turner Vicar of West-Hadden 
and Edward Andrews, it is ordered,
that the said Vicar shall have by reason
of the words (<term lang="la">Altaragium cum manso
competenti</term>) contained in the composition
of the profits assigned for the Vicar's
maintenance, all such things as he ought 
to have by these words, according to the
definition thereof made by the Reverend
Father in God John Bishop of London,
upon conference with the Civilians, viz.
David Hewes Judge of the Admiralty,
Bartholomew Clerk Dean of the Arches,
John Gibson, Henry Joanse, Laurence
Hewes, and Edward Stanhope, all Do&shy;
ctors of the Civil Law: that is to say, by
Altaragium, Tithes of wool, lambs, colts,
calfs, piggs, goslings, chickens, butter,
cheese, hemp, flax, honey, fruits, herbs,
and such other small Tithes, with offer&shy;
ings that shall be due within the parish
of West-Haddon. 

And the like case was for Norton in
Northamptonshire, heard in this Court
within these two or three years, upon
the hearing ordered in the like manner.

Which Judgement I presume was 
grounded on these and the like autho&shy;
rities. <term lang="la">Vicarius de Colingham habeat

Hampton-Gay to the Abbat and Con&shy;

it should next be vacant, and then im&shy;

Incumbent, or got it void by resigna&shy;
tion or exchange, p. 407. One great 
mischief of Appropriations was this,
In the Ordination of a Vicarage the
Altarage or voluntary Oblations were
often divided between the Vicar and
the Religious, which soon lessened the
charity and piety of Christian People,
who grew less free in their Offerings,
when they found a great share must go
away from the Parish-Priest, to whom 
they design'd that bounty, p. 455. The
Religious very apt to oppress the Vicar,
by throwing procurations and other
burdens on them, and particularly, 
when they had convenanted to maintain a
Capellane in some Chappel of ease
within the parish, they shifted off that
charge, and cast it on the Vicar, p. 588.
That the Bishops might not lose by
granting their assent to Appropriations,
they sometimes compounded with the 
Religious for an annual persion to an&shy;
swer the dues that might otherwise arise
to their See from the succession of
Rectors: So in the appropriating of
Merton to the Abby of Egnesham, -
<term lang="la">Reservamus insuper nobis &amp; successori&shy;

pretension of Appropriating Benefices
to the use of the Religious, as to en&shy;
able them the better to relieve the poor,
and in the form of Appropriation it was
sometimes expresly ordain'd, that a per&shy;
petual portion should be alotted at the
discretion of the Bishop to relieve the 
indigent parishioners: So when the
Church of Charlton upon Ottmoor was

by arms, wherein the Appellant or

cepter, were at a fixt time and place to
engage in single Combat, either by
themselves, or by their deputies, and
the cause was adjudg'd to the Conque&shy;
rour. This fierce practise was allow'd 
and confirm'd by the laws of Will. the
Conquerour, Cap. 68, 69. and those of 
Hen. I. Cap. 45, 49. and some new or&shy;
ders prescrib'd for the regulation of it.
Leg. Hen. I. Cap. 59. So that it is an
evident mistake in the late ingenious
Author of An Introduction to the History
of England, that William the Conque&shy;
rour endeavoured to abolish two antient
forms of Trial used among the Saxons
with great Reverence, even during their 
Christian worship. - These were the 
Trials Ordeal and of Camp fight. p. 246.
- Both these sorts of Trial this King
abolished as unchristian and unjust, and
reduced all causes to the judgement of
Equals, or of a Jury of twelve Neigh&shy;
bours, and by legal forms, p. 249.
When it is certain, the Trial of Camp&shy;
fight or Duel, was no custom peculiar
to the Anglo-Saxons, but was the 
practise of most Northern Nations,
especially of the Franks and Normans,
and was indeed introduc'd by William
the Conqueror, not found here as an anti&shy;
ent usage, much less abolish'd by him. He
made no one order to cancel or to re&shy;
strain it, but made an express Law to 
license and authorize it. Before the
Conquest not one Law or one Example
of the practise, but after the Conquest
some publick Laws, and very many
Precedents. <term lang="la">Hoc genus (i. e. Duelli) a

Thus it is to write History without sta&shy;

late. Alass, History is a very sacred
subject; and tho' matters of opinion may
admit of desultory Essays, yet matters

tegrity and judgement. - This Camp&shy;
fight or Duelling was of two sorts, ei&shy;

Trial of Estates; both these are anti&shy;

the latter sort, there was a solemn al&shy;

Of the former kind, the last Example
was in 6. Car. I. between Donald Lord

In our Sea terms, we have still several

low situation in a bottom, or at the

shire, Oxfordshire, &amp;c. p. 109. Hence
our Country-men retain the word
comb or coom for the bin or low place,

their horses. So in Wiltshire the <term lang="wt">comb</term>

crooked, as if Cambria from its situa&shy;

the Doom-book, or Register from which

observe (because no notice has been

addition of dey or day, (Dome-boc,
Domesday-book) does not augment the
sense of the word, but only doubles

<wordentry type="h"><form lang="en">TITHE.</form><xpln lang="en" lexeme="tithe(n)"> Two parts of the tithe of
a Mannor or Parish were often given
to a Religious house: of which the rea&shy;
son was this. Tithe of England in the
time of Augustin the Monk was divided
commonly into four parts: and in the
reign of King Alfred reduc'd to three
parts, of which a first part to the re&shy;
pair of Churches, a second to the re&shy;
lief of the poor, and a third only to 
the maintenance of the Parish Priest.
Hence the Lords of Mannors at their
first building of Churches did often
allot no more than that third part of
tithes for an exhibition to the Parish
Priest, and kept the other two parts
in their own hands for the uses of the
Church and Poor: till by degrees they
either gave in the two other parts to 
the Parochial Priest, or else with the
Bishop's consent assign'd them to some
Religious house, p. 79. This was the
meaning of giving two garbs or theavs
or sheaves to the Religious, while the
third garb remain'd due to the Parish
Priest, p. 81. So Brien Fitz-Count gave
a third part of the tithe of his demesne
in Hillingdon to the Monastery of Eve&shy;
sham, p. 100. So Robert de Oily to the
Secular Canons of St. George in the
Castle of Oxford, - <term lang="la">Duas partes deci&shy;

p. 205. By the Laws of King Edgar
made about 670. if a Thane or Lord
should have within his own fee a 
Church with a burial place, i. e. a pa&shy;
rish Church, he must give the third
part of his tithe to it. But if it had no
privilege of burial, i. e. if it were only
a Chappel of ease depending on a 
Mother Church, then the Lord was to
maintain the Priest out of his nine parts. 
p. 594. Two parts of the tithe of the
demesne of Heyford-Warine was given
to the Chappel of St. Georges, and
thence transferr'd to the Abby of Ose&shy;
ney, p. 513. In the Mannor of Che&shy;
sterton, the Abby of Glocester had two
parts of the tithe of the demesne land,
which they firm'd out to the Abbat and
Convent of Oseney, who as Appropria&shy;
tors had the third part, p. 223. This
division of tithe was the occasion of
disputes and quarrels, and therefore one
part was often brought off, and united 
to the other; or at least one share
rented out to those who had the other,
that the whole tithe might be collected
together. So the Monks of Egnesham
compounded within the Canons of Bur&shy;
cester, to receive a yearly pension of
twelve shilling in lieu of their two
parts of tithe in Stratton, p. 144. Two
parts of the tithe of Burcester belong'd
first to St. Georges, and then to Oseney
Abby, till in 28. Edw. I. the Abbat
and Canons of Oseney resign'd their
right of two parts to the Prior and Ca&shy;
