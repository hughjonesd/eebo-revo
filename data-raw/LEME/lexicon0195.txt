To the fauourable Studious Ingenious Reader
touching these Diffinitions and Theoremes, concerning the newe
Science of great Artillerie.</heading>

THe Auncient Philosophers and Mathematicians that were either
the first Founders or amplifiers of any Science with newe and
rare Inuentions, were euer enforced at the first to vse manye 
newe and vnaccustomed names to distinguish and breefely to
expresse such seuerall subiects as the Methodes of their dis&#173;
courses did occasion them to handell. Let no man therefore 
marueil, if my selfe being now to Intreate of so newe and rare
a Science as this of great Artillerie bee also enforced to vse
sundrie strange tearmes, not vnderstande perhaps of the verye Artificers themselues
that most Manedge that kinde of Engine. For albeit in all such vsual actions as Can&#173;
noniers commonly practize, they haue wordes good inough to expresse their owne
meanings. (And therein I vse also the same, except I finde them verye improper or
misaplied) yet in the remote and hidden mysteries of Randonnes and of the seuerall
Proportions of the mettaline Bodies and Soules or Cylinders of all seueral Peeces
and of the strange varietie of the Circuites of all Bullets in the Ayre, by reason of the
repugnance or variance of the violent and natural motions: In these Mysteries I say
scarsly thought on, and farre beyond the compasse of ordinary Cannoniers without
exquisite knowledge in the Mathematicall Sciences to intermeddle withall. I finde
not anye wordes in vse that can serue my purpose, and haue therefore chosen such as
in my iudgement are most proper and effectual, and to take awaye all obscuritye, 
haue set downe euery of their Diffinitions that are not in my Pantometria, alreadye
sufficiently explaned: which Booke together with my Stratioticos, amplyfied with
new Additions, I haue new published as Pathes to leade y ingenious Countrimen
to the vnderstanding also of this newe Science, when I shall publish the same in her
best perfection. And in the meane time as many yeares sithence I propounded pub&#173;
likely sundry Questions concerning this facultie, to stirre vp bothe Theorical and
Practical spirites of all sortes more profoundly to searche the hidden secrets of this
Arte. So haue I nowe thougtht good to Imprint also these halfe hundered Theoremes,
resoluing the most part of all those my former Propositions, wherein I must neuer&#173;
thelesse admonish the reader that I haue enterlaced a verie fewe that are not in the
seuere examination of Geometrical Demonstration perfectly exact, albeit they ap&#173;
proche so nighe as ordinarie experiments will hardly discouer the difference, which
I haue of purpose doone, the rather to animate Mathematical Practisioners by tri&#173;
all to finde them out, and thereby perhaps also to discouer other more rare Secrets
then I haue hitherto thought vpon. For by experience my selfe haue founde manye
rare Mysteries in that Science, which I should neuer once haue amused on, if suche
Scales and Theorikes (as my Father by his long painefull chargeable experiences in
great Ordinance ioyned with his Mathematicall Science first inuented) had beene
reduced to their accomplished perfection. And yet without those first principles
left mee I must truely confesse I might haue spent the greatest part of my life in
meere obscuritie, albeit I had by Office or otherwise enioyed the Manedging

of all sorts of great Artillerie at my owne pleasure charge free. The burden where
no doubte hath beene the cheefest cause that so many rare Mathematicians as Tarta&#173;
lea the Italian and diuers others of these late ages in Europe haue mistaken so much,
and performed so little toward the accomplishment of that Science. And although
by publishing the same my Treatize of Martiall Pyrotechnie and great Artillery in
the Latin toong, I should I knowe greatlye amplifie myne owne Fame, and the admi&#173;
ration of such rare Mathematicians as at this daye liue in seuerall Nations of Chri&#173;
stendome, from whome I haue for farre inferior Inuentions Imprinted in my Trea&#173;
tize, Intituled <term lang="la">Ala seu scala Mathematica</term>, already receiued no small applause. Yet if
I publish the same at all, I doe constantly resolue to doe it onely in my Natiue Lan&#173;
guage: Aswell to make the benefite thereof the more priuate to my Countreymen,
as also to make thereby other Nations to affect as much our Language as my selfe
haue desired to learne the Highe Dutche: for the workes onely of two Famous men
that wrote their Bookes in that toong, which cannot possiblye by anye other that
haue not the same Spirites and perfection that was in the verie Authors be Transla&#173;
ted: as appeareth euidently by diuerse Treatizes vtterlye peruerted by the mista&#173;
kings and misconceauings of the Translators.
These <term lang="la">Praeludia</term> therefore of a matter more serious and Important, good Rea&#173;

speedelye to imparte the rest, which some con&#173;
trarye effect hath hitherto
detayned from
