Such an Antagonist hath Fortune allotted me, to 
purge mel<expan type="a+_">an</expan>acholy, and to thrust me vpon the Stage: which 
I must now loade, like the old subiect of my new prayse. 
There is no warring with Destiny: and the Lord of my 
leysure will haue it so. Much good may it do the puppy 
of S. Fame, so to confute, and so to be confuted. Where 
his intelligence faileth, (as God wotteth, it faileth often) 
he will be so bold, without more inquiry, to checke the 
common sense of Reason, with the proper sense of his I&shy;
magination, infinitly more high in conceit, then deepe in 
vnderstanding: and where any phrase, or word presumeth
to approch within his swing, that was not before enrow&shy;
led in the Common-places of his paperbooke, it is pre&shy;
sently meere Inkhornisme: albeit he might haue heard 
thesame from a thousand mouthes of Iudgement, or read 
it in more then an hundred writings of estimation. Pytha&shy;
goras Silence was woont to be a rule for Ignorance, or Im&shy;
maturity: (no better bitt for vnlearned, or vnexpert youth, 
then Pythagoras Silence:) but Vnderstand, or not Vnder&shy;

vnderstand not, it is either Cabalisme in matter, or Ink&shy;
hornisme in forme: whether he be ripe, or vnripe, all is 
raw, or rotten, that pleaseth not his Imperiall tast. Had he 
euer studied any Pragmaticall Discourse; or perused any 
Treaties of Confederacy, of peace, of truce, of intercourse, 
of other forrein negotations (that is specially noted for 
one of my Inkhorne wordes); or researched any actes, and 
monuments, Ciuill, or Ecclesiasticall; or looked into any 
Lawes, Statutes, Iniunctions, Proclamations, (na, it is one 
of his witty flowtes, <f type="i">He beginnes, like a Proclamation:<f type="r"> but 
few Treatises better penned, then some Proclamati<expan type="o+_">on</expan>s): or 
had he seene any autenticall instruments, Pragmatique ar&shy;
ticles, or other Politique Traicts: he would rather haue 
woondred I should Vse so fewe formall termes, (which I 
purposely auoided, as not so vulgarly familiar) then haue 
maruelled at any, which I vsed. He is of no reading in com&shy;
parison, that doth not acknowledge euery terme in those 
Letters to be autenticall English; and allow a thousand o&shy;
ther ordinary Pragmaticall termes, more straunge then the 
straungest in those Letters, yet current at occasion. The 
ignorant Idiot (for so I will prooue him in very truth) con&shy;
futeth the artificiall wordes, which he neuer read: but the 
vayne fellow (for so he prooueth himselfe in word, and 
deede) in a phantasticall emulation presumeth to forge a
