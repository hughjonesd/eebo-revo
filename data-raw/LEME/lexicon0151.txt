may be, who knoweth 
not what woordes are 
necessarie to make an 
estate in fee simple, fee 
taile, for terme of lyfe, 
or such like, besides 
many other mischiefs. 
I will therefore sett 
you here downe some 
of those cases that are 
most common in igno&#173;
rant mens mouthes, &#38; 
do carie by the wise 
interpretacions of the 
Iudges, as is afore&#173;
said, a larger and more 
fauorable s<expan type="e+_">en</expan>ce in wils 
then in deedes: first 
therefore if one deuise 
to I.S. by his will, 
all his landes and te&#173;
nements, here not on&#173;
ly al those lands that 
hee hath in possession 
</page>
 
<page sig="66r">
do passe, but also those 
that he hath the reuer&#173;
sion of, by vertue of 
these wordes tene&#173;
ments. 
 
And if lands be de&#173;
uised to a man to haue 
to him for euermore, or 
to haue to him and his 
assignes, in these two 
cases the deuisee shall 
haue a fee simple. But 
if it be geeuen by feffe&#173;
ment in such maner, he 
hath but an estate for 
terme of life. 
 
Also if a man deuise 
his lande to another, 
to geeue, sell, or doe 
therewith at his plea&#173;
sure or will, this is 
fee simple. 
 
A deuyse made to one 
&#38; to his heires males, 
doth make an estate 
taile, but if suche 
woordes bee put in a 
deede of feoffement, it 
shalbe taken in fee sim&#173;

not appeare of what 
bodye the heyres

there the land shal re&#173;

it is of such a deuise, 
for there the s<expan type="o+_">on</expan>ne of <expan type="y+e">the</expan>
daughter shal haue it 
rather then the wyll 
shall be voide. 
 
If one deuise to an 
Enfant in hys mo&#173;

goode deuise, other&#173;

A deuise made (in 
</page>
 
<page sig="67r">
fee simple)without ex&#173;
presse words of heires 
is good in fee simple. 
 
But if a deuise bee 
to I. N. he shall haue 
the lande but for term 
of life, for those wordz 
will carry no greater 
estate. 
 
If one wil that his 
sone I. shall haue his 
land after the deathe 
of his wife, here the 
wife of the <emend err="deuisonr">deuisour</emend>
shall haue the lande, 
first for terme of her 
life. So likewise if a 
man deuise his goodes 
to his wife, and that 
after the decease of his

heire shall haue the 
house where <expan type="y+e">the</expan> goodes 
are, there <expan type="y+e">the</expan> sonne shal 
not haue the house du&#173;

for it doth appeare that

he that is mad, nor <expan type="y+e">the</expan>

were included in mea&#173;
ninge. And thus equi&#173;

a graunt of the conty&#173;

which euer since they 
haue vsed in the same 
countrey, &#38; thus they 
are as followeth. 
 
&#182; The Customes of Kent 
 
THese are the vsa&#173;
ges &#38; customes, the 
which the comminalty 
of Kent claymeth to 
haue in the tenements 
of Gauelkind, &#38; in the 
men of Gauelkind, al&#173;
lowed in Eire before 
Iohn of Berwicke &#38; 
his Compainions the 
Iustices in Eire in 
Kent, the xxj. yere of

That is to say, that 
all the bodies of Ken&#173;

</page>
 
<page sig="102v">
as the other free bo&#173;

This thing hath ben 
since confessed <emend err="so">to</emend> bee 
true, as it appeareth in 
30. E. I. in Fitzherbert 
titulo Villenage pla&#173;
cito 46. Where it is 
holden sufficient for a 
man to auoyde the ob&#173;
iection of bondage, to 
say that hys father 
was borne in Kent. 
But whether it wyll 
serue in <expan type="y+t">that</expan> case to say, 
<expan type="y+t">that</expan> him selfe was borne 
in Kent, it is (for good 
reason) to be doubted. 
 
2  And <expan type="y+t">that</expan> they ought 
not the Eschetour of 
the king to chose, nor 
euer in any time dyd 
they. But the kinge 
shall take or cause to 
be taken such a one as 
it shall please him, to 
serue him in <expan type="y+t">that</expan> which 
shalbe needefull.

<page sig="103r">
of their Lordes: Sa&#173;
uing vnto the Lordes

4  And that all, and 
euery of them, may by 
writ of the king, or by 
plaint, pled for the ob&#173;
tayning of their right, 
aswell of their Lordes 
as of other men. 
 
5  And they claime al<emend err="">&#173;</emend>
so, that the c<expan type="o+_">om</expan>minaltie 
of Gauelkinde menne 
which hold none other 
then tenements of ga&#173;
uelkind nature, ought 
not to come to the co&#173;

Eire, but onely by the 
Borsholder, &#38; iiij. men 
of the Borough. Ex&#173;
cept the towns which 
ought to aunswere by 
xij. men in the Eire. 
 
The like to this pri&#173;

vnreasonable in gy&#173;
uing such scope and li&#173;
berty to so yong yeres, 
yet vpon the good con&#173;

as it was holden by

&#38; 5. Phi, &#38; Mary, as 
Iustice Dalison hath

it is said, that if a man

Now followeth to 
bee spoken howe farre 
thys custome exten&#173;
deth it selfe wythin 
this our Countrey of 
Kent &#38;c. 
 
It is commonlye 
taken that the cus&#173;
tome of Gauelkinde 
</page>
 
<page sig="124r">
is general, &#38; spreadeth 
it selfe throughout the 
whole Shire into all 
lands subiect by aun&#173;
cient tenure vnto the 
same, such places only 
excepted, where it is 
altered by act of par&#173;
lyament. And there&#173;
fore in 5. E. 4. 18. and 
14. H. 4. 8. it is sayd, 
that the Custome of 
Gauelkinde is (as it 
were a common lawe 
in Kent. And the 
booke 22. E. 4. 19. 
affirmeth, that in de&#173;
maunding Gauelkind 
lande, a man shall not 
neede to prescribe in 
certeyne, and to shew 
that the Towne, Bo&#173;
roughe, or Citye, 
where the landes be, 
is an auncient towne, 
Boroughe, or Cy&#173;

tie, and that the cus&#173;

(time out of mynde) 
that the landes with&#173;
in the same Towne, 
Borough, or Citie, 
should discende to all 
the heires males &#38;c. 
But that is sufficient<emend err="">&#173;</emend>
ly inough to shew the 
Custome at large, and 
to say, that the lande 
lieth in Kent, and that 
all the lands there bee 
of the nature of Ga&#173;
uelkind. For a writ of 
particion of landes in 
Gauelkind) saith M. 
Littleton) shall bee as 
generall, as if the 
lands were at the co&#173;
mon lawe, although 
the declaration ought 
specyally to containe 
mencion of the Cus&#173;
tome of the Coun&#173;
trey. This vniuer&#173;
salytie considered, and 
also the strayte bonde 
(whereby the cus&#173;
tome is so <emend err="inserablye">inseperablye</emend>
knit to the lande, as 
in manner nothynge 
but an acte of Parli&#173;
ment can clerely dis&#173;

eth, that no place 
Citye, Towne, or

<page sig="125r">
Borough within this

Thus much beinge 
spoken touchinge the 
name, tenure, nature, 
generalty, and order 
of Gauelkind: it shall 
nowe bee shewed of 
what qualitie <expan type="y+e">the</expan> rents,

(of the which some be 
issuinge out of these

some bee raised by rea&#173;

And of th<expan type="e+_">em</expan> some shall

land &#38; other some shal 
keepe the same course 
that comm<expan type="o+_">on</expan> law hath

<page sig="125v">
appointed. And there&#173;
fore if a rent be gra<expan type="u+_">un</expan>&#173;
ted in fee out of Ga&#173;
uelkinde lande, it shal 
dyscende to all the 
males as the lande it 
selfe shal do, as appea&#173;
reth in 14. H. 8. 5. 26. 
H. 8. 4. &#38; 4. E. 3. 
 
But if ij. iointen<expan type="a+_">an</expan>ts 
of land in Gauelkinde 
grant a r<expan type="e+_">en</expan>t charge out 
of that land to I. S. 
&#38; to his heires, and I. 
S. dieth hauing issue 
ij. sonnes, this r<expan type="e+_">en</expan>t shal 
not disc<expan type="e+_">en</expan>d to both the 
sonnes of I. S. but to 
the heire at the com&#173;
mon law because that 
the custome is in sus&#173;
pence during the ioin&#173;
ture by the opinion of 
the ryght worship&#173;
full Christopher Yel&#173;
uerton Esquire, at 
his reading in Graies 
Inne in lent Anno. 
1573. 
 
So if a tenauncye

seruice by which it is 
holden may discende 
according to the com&#173;

of opinion. 
 
If a remaynder of 
Gauelkinde lande bee 
tayled to the heires 
males, they altoge&#173;
ther shall inherite as 
Fitzherbert &#38; Norwich. 
thought 26. H. 8. 4. 
But that is to be vn&#173;
derstoode of a dyscent 
onely, for if landes of 
Gauelkinde nature be 
leased for lyfe, the re&#173;
mainder to the ryght 
heires of Iohn Stile 
which hath issue fo&#173;
wer sonnes and dy&#173;
eth, and after the les&#173;
see for lyfe dyeth, 
nowe the eldest sonne 
onely of Iohn Stile 
shall haue this lande, 
for hee is right heire, 
&#38; that is a good name 
of purchase 37. H. 8. 
is Master Brooke <term lang="la"><expan type="tit'">titulo</expan></term>
</page>
 
<page sig="126v">
Done &#38; Remaynder 
42. But if the landes 
had bin giuen to Iohn 
Stile for life, the re&#173;

heire male, this had 
bin as estate tayle in 
Iohn Stile him selfe, 
and then the lande 
shoulde haue discen&#173;
ded to al his sonnes, 
in so much as in that 
case the wordes (next 
heire male) bee not a 
name of purchase. 
Howebeit yt was 
greatly doubted 3. &#38; 
4. Ph. &#38; Ma. (as Ius&#173;
tice Dalison reporteth) 
if a remainder be de&#173;
uised by testament (to 
the next heire male) 
whether in that case 
the eldest brother one&#173;
ly shall haue it, in 
so much as (in the 
vnderstanding of the 
lawe, which is a iudge 
ouer al customes) he 
is the next heire male 
and therefore inquire 
of it. 
</page>
 
<page sig="127r">
As touchinge vou&#173;

E. 4. that al the heirs 
in gauelkind shal bee 
vouched for the war&#173;

onely. But the opiny&#173;
on of master Littlet<expan type="o+_">on</expan>
li. 3. cap. 13. and of <expan type="y+e">the</expan>
Iustices 22. E. 4. is 
clere that the eldest

rebutted, or barred by 
the warranty of the 
auncestor: to be short, 
the eldest sonne onely 
shal enter for <expan type="y+e">the</expan> breach

rest of the brethren 
shall be ioined with 
him in suinge a writt

And they all shall bee 
charged for the debt of 
their auncestor, if so be 
<expan type="y+t">that</expan> they all haue assets
