T<f type="i">O Expatiate in En&shy;
comiums on the Ma&shy;
thematicks, were 
to Gild Gold; an 
Undertaking vain 
and impertinent. 
This sort of Learning has sufficiently 
justifi'd its Excellency, both from the 
Certainty of its Principles, and Use&shy;
fulness of its Practise, to all Ingenious 
Men.

Nor had the number of its Vota&shy;
ries been so few as they are, had not 
the difficulty of the Terms (some</f> Ara&shy;
bick, <f type="i">most</f> Greek, <f type="i">and divers of them
</f>Latine, <f type="i">according as they have 

</page>
<page sig="a4v">

been derived to us from the most 
Learned of those respective Nations, 
in several Ages) deterr'd many of 
great Natural Parts from wading in&shy;
to its Mysteries, or at least clowded
its ravishing Beauties from their 
Eyes. 

To remedy this, and at once promote 
such Praise-worthy and advantagious 
Arts, and serve the young Students 
therein, I have taken the pains to 
Collect and Explain the Hard Words, 
Difficult Terms, and Abstruse Phrases 
used by Authors, in all the several 
Mathematical Sciences, and Branches 
depending thereupon; than which, 
nothing has hitherto more discouraged 
hopeful</f> Tyro'<f ype="i">s from Proficiency.

But here is offered them a Key, 
that will open to them the choicest 
Treasures of</f> Urania, <f type="i">and her Sub&shy;
lunary Handmaids: Nay, We have 
taken care to demonstrate the Na&shy;
ture of the Things, as well as genu&shy; 

</page>
<page sig="a5r">

ine Sence of the Words; and to rivet 
them in the Understanding, have ac&shy;
commodated the Senses with Demon&shy;
strative Diagrams, where they are 
requisite. 

If any useful Terms have escaped 
our diligence, let the Reader consi&shy;
der the Nature of the Work, impossi&shy;
ble to be begun and perfected at once: 
for we were forced to trace an almost 
Untrodden-Path.

If any Errors have been commit&shy;
<emend err="mit"></emend>ed in the Interpretation (as who 
in such Variety dare pretend to a full 
and perfect understanding how, and
in what sence every Author has used 
a Word) let Imbecility of Judgment, 
or Defect of Memory be pardoned, 
but zealous good will for propagating 
of Arts be encouraged, which was
never more cordially designed than in 
this Work: But the performance is 
submitted to the Charity of thy Cen&shy;
sure.

</page>
<page sig="a5v">

A main thing which induced me 
to this Undertaking, was from Expe&shy;
rience, how much such a Work was 
wanting: For about thirty years 
ago, when I first began to apply my 
self to Mathematical Learning, I 
found my self not a little perplex'd 
with the difficult Terms used by Au&shy;
thors, and therefore then began to 
Collect such hard Words as I met
with, that I might either by my 
Reading, or Enquiry of some of my 
Mathematical Acquaintance, learn to 
know the meaning of them. Thus 
have I ever since been storing up 
Words and their Interpretations, with 
</f>Memorandums <f type="i">in what Book and 
Folio I might find their Definitions 
or Explanations, against I should be 
ready to digest them into an Alpha&shy;
betical Method; which at last 
(though long first) I did, and intend&shy;
ed then speedily to have finished this 
Book. But finding my self encum&shy; 

</page>
<page sig="a6r">

in many other Concerns, I con&shy;
sidered the Task would be too tedious 
for me to run through alone, and 
therefore desired the assistance of my 
good Friend, Mr.</f> H. C. <f type="i">by whose 
pains it is at last arrived to what 
you see. 

It is true, that since this was, as 
aforesaid, Collected, I did light on 
</f>Vitalis, <f type="i">a</f> French <f type="i">Author, Printed in 
Latin; and by comparing my Colle&shy;
ctions and his Book, I found I had ga&shy;
thered more Words</f> purely Mathema&shy;
tical, <f type="i">than he had done: But he hath 
indeed inserted the Names of most 
Stars, and upon them made somewhat 
long Discourses; which, before I saw 
his Book, I had also Collected: But 
upon consideration, that it would
make this Book swell beyond its in&shy;
tended Size, and that they would 
prove of small vse to <f type="i">English<f type="r"> Begin&shy;
ners, I left them out.

Having given thee this Account, 

</page>
<page sig="a6v">

it onely remains to advertize thee a 
word or two for thy better apprehensi&shy;
on of the scope of the Book. 

First, Consider, 'Tis intended for 
Beginners, not Accomplish'd Artists, 
therefore adapted to the meanest Ca&shy;
pacities; preferring sometimes a 
Plain, Familiar, and Intelligible De&shy;
scription, before a Rigid, Abstruse 
(though Exact) Definition: Nay, 
rather (though rarely) venturing up&shy;
on a Repetition, than running the 
hazard of not being understood.

Secondly, Observe, We have in 
most places hinted the Derivation of 
the Word, which both assists the Me&shy;
mory, and informs the Understand&shy;
ing: yet have put the</f> Greek <f type="i">words 
in</f> English <f type="i">Characters; for those 
that understand</f> Greek <f type="i">know them 
well enough now; but those that do 
not, could not perhaps have read them
otherwise, so much as to have perceiv&shy;
ed any Analogy between them and 

</page>
<page sig="a7r">

the Words, we say owe their Original 
to them. 

Thirdly, The Letter</f> G. <f type="i">or sometimes</f>
Gr. <f type="i">shows the Word Originally</f> Greek; 
<f type="i">and</f> L. <f type="i">or</f> Lat. Latin.<f type="r"> And what is 
included between these two</f> [] <f type="i">Crot&shy;
chets, is the natural, strict, and pro&shy;
per Signification of the Word; what 
follows is the Mathematical acception: 
and in that where I have been forc'd
to use any hard Word, I have ex&shy;
plain'd it by another Synonymous (of 
the same signification) in a Parenthe&shy;
sis immediately following.</f>

those in whose stead they are Constituted, do Pro&shy;

when 4 Numbers have proportion one to the other, 
the Sum of the Logarithm of the first and last shall

for Example, take two Numbers, 4 and 8, where

tedious Circuit through Multiplication and Divi&shy;
sion, that a 4th Number unknown, may be found

for the Friday next is <f type="i">Good-Friday</f>, as the day 
whereon our Blessed Saviour suffered for the sins 
of mankind. Then comes <f type="i">Easter-Sunday</f>, cele&shy;
brated in memory of our Saviour's Resurrection, 
which is the Foundation and Rule for all the movea&shy;
ble Feasts. After this follows the <f type="i">Quinquagesimal</f>, 
or space of 50 days between <f type="i">Easter</f> and <f type="i">Whitson&shy;
tide.</f> All which the Ancient Christians kept as a 
Festival, containing 6 Sundays: The first <f type="i"><term lang="la">Quasi&shy;

bis</term></f>, because those that were Baptized at <f type="i">Easter</f>, used 
to go in <f type="i">White</f> Garments all the week, which this 
day at night they left off. The second Sunday is 
called <f type="i"><term lang="la">Misericordia</term></f>, from <f type="i">Psalm</f> 32. 5. The third 
<f type="i"><term lang="la">Jubilate</term></f>, from <f type="i">Psalm</f> 65. 1. The fourth, <f type="i"><term lang="la">Cantate</term></f>, 
from <f type="i">Psalm</f> 97. 1. The fifth, <f type="i"><term lang="la">Vocem Jucunditatis</term></f>, 
from the <f type="i"><term lang="la">Introit</term></f> that day beginning so; 'tis also 
called <f type="i">Rogation-Sunday</f>, and the whole week fol&shy;
lowing, <f type="i">Rogation-week</f>, because then they made 

</page>
<page sig="g6v">

their Processions into the Fields, said the Litany, 
and made their Prayers and Requests [<f type="i">Rogationes</f>] 
to God publickly. The Thursday in this week is 
<f type="i">Holy Thursday</f>, kept in memory of our Saviour's 
Ascension into Heaven. The last is called <f type="i"><term lang="la">Exaudi</term></f>, 
from that of <f type="i">Psal.</f> 27. <f type="i">Hear, O Lord, my voice.</f> 
Then succeeds the Grand Feast, called by us <f type="i">Whit&shy;
sontide</f>, (because people appeared in such colour'd 
Garments anciently;) but in Greek <f type="i">Pentecost.</f> Which, 
as it was observed by the Jews in memory of the 
Promulgation of the Law at <f type="i">Mount Sinai</f>, just 50 
days after their Pass-over, so Christians observe it 
the seventh Sunday after <f type="i">Easter</f>, (called still <f type="i">Pas&shy;
cha</f>,) by reason that then the Holy Ghost was sent, 
and the Gift of Tongues conferr'd upon the A&shy;
postles. The next is <f type="i">Trinity Sunday</f>, and from 
thence the Sundays are reckon'd in order; as first, 
second, third, <f type="i">&amp;c.</f> after <f type="i">Trinity</f>, to the first Sunday 
in <f type="i">Advent.</f> Which time of <f type="i">Advent</f> [or <f type="i">Coming</f>] 
being a kind of Preparation for the Grand Festi&shy;
val of our Lord's Birth, contains the four Sundays 
next before <f type="i">Christmass;</f> and are reckon'd by num&shy;
ber, as first, second, <f type="i">&amp;c.</f> Sunday in <f type="i">Advent.</f> And 
thus much of Movable Feasts, which may seem a 
Digression, but not to be condemn'd by them that 
perhaps had never heard so much, if they had not 
met it here.</xpln></wordentry>

in a Ray obliquely cast, or when a Star, not being 
Vertical, projects his Beams, as it were, on one

Earth: For when 'tis Vertical, casting its Beams 
directly to the Superficies, it must needs pass by

Parallax: Therefore the further they are from 
the Zenith, and nearer the Horizon, so much the

formed by Numbers, and retaining each his own 
name, extends it self to consider the others Quan&shy;
tity, according to the divers reason of Proportions, 
and habitude of one thing to another; applying 
afterwards to Continued Quantity what was made 
out by <f type="i">Quantity Discrete:</f> And on the contrary, 
feigning in Numbers all the Passions of Continued 
Quantity, that what in one is conspicuous, may 
be made appear so in the other, by the same reason 
of Habitude. Thus in <f type="i">Quantity Discrete</f>, 'tis as 
easie as in <f type="i">Continued</f>, to assign a Whole and Parts, 
Indivisible Points, which are Units, composing the 
same Discrete Quantity, Numbers, Plain, Solid, 
Square, and all other sorts of Figures. The <f type="i">Arith&shy;
metical Proportion</f> therefore is, when three or more 
Numbers proceed with the same difference, as 
4, 7, 10, 13, 16, &amp;c. each Number exceeding 
that which goes before by the Number Three. But 
the <f type="i">Geometrical Proportion</f> is, when three or more 
Numbers have the same Reason, as 2, 6, 18, 54, 
162, &amp;c. where every Number bears the same pro&shy;
portion to that which precedes, or <f type="i">Triple Reason</f>, 
containing three times as much.

Now those Quantities are said to be <f ype="i">Commensurable</f>,

Quantities have no Aliquot parts; that is, there 
is no common Measure given that may measure 
them; as is the Diameter of a Square, and the Side 
of the same Square: For though each of those

the Third, &amp;c. yet 'tis not an Aliquot part com&shy;

there is a Point conceived, to which all Lines 
drawn from the Superficies are equal. 

But in Astronomy 'tis taken more specially for

tude, or respect of the parts of the Earth to its 
Poles, is said to be either Right or Oblique.

A Right or Direct Sphere hath both the Poles of the
World in the Horizon, &amp; the Equinoctial transiting 
the Zenith; so that all the Circles parallel to the E&shy;
quator make Right Angles with the Horizon, and 
by it are divided into two equal parts, the <f type="i">Sun, Moon</f>,

hours above, and 12 hours

quently the Days and Nights

and is called <f type="i">Right</f>, because 
all the Celestial Bodies, by the 
Diurnal motion of the <f type="i">Pri&shy;

above, and Descend directly below the Horizon 
As at the Isle of St. <f type="i">Lawrence</f>, and other places 
under the Equator. The adjoyned Figure is a re&shy;
presentation of the Right Sphere.

</page>
<page sig="l1v">

An Oblique Sphere is, 
where one of the Poles is ele&shy;
vated above, the other de&shy;
pressed below the Horizon; 
as in all places wide of the 
Equator. The adjoyned Fi&shy;
gure is a representation of the 
Oblique Sphere.

A <f type="i">Parallel Sphere</f> is so called, 
because there the Equator 
lies directly in the Horizon, 
and in parallel thereunto; the 
whole year there being but 
as one Natural day, <f type="i">viz.</f> one 
half year Day, and the other 
Night. The adjoyning Figure 
represents a Parallel Sphere.

From this division of the Sphere arises the di&shy;
versity of Ascensions, to wit, of the Degrees of 
the Equator, and parts answering thereunto, thence 
denominated <f type="i">Right</f> or <f type="i">Oblique.</f> For in a Right 
Sphere, all the Ascensions are Right; but in an 
Oblique Sphere, Oblique.

All which is demonstrated sensibly in that Ma&shy;
thematical Instrument called the Sphere, which 
hence takes its name, having the Poles, Lines, and 
Great Circles therein represented.

Besides this, the Orb of each Planet is called, 
the Sphere of such a Planet: and sometimes the
