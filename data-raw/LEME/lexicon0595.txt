<heading>PREFACE.</heading>

THis Paper was not to come abroad with&shy;
out a Preface as well as Comment, for 
Instruction of our young Master, who 
newly launch'd from the University
(where he has lost a year or two) 
is not yet Travell'd, or if haply he has made <term lang="la">le petit 
Tour</term> (with the formal thing his Governour *) having 
never yet Read Tully's Offices through, since he came 
from School sets up for a Beau, and Equipp'd for the 
Town at his Return, comes to seek Adventures in an 
Ocean full of Rocks, and Shelves, and wants a Skilful 
Pilot to Steer him, as much as any Vessel that goes 
to the Indies; and oftentimes returns home Leaky,
and as poorly freighted, as those who have been near 
Shipwrack'd or lost their Voyage.

It is for direction of such as are setting out towards 
this great and famous Emporium (whether the design be 
for Miss or Marriage) what Cargo he must provide; 
not as Merchants do for America, Glass-Beads, and 
Baubles, in exchange for Gold and Pearl; but Gold 
and Pearl, and all that's precious, for that which is of 
less value than Knives and Childrens Rattles.   
</page>

<page sig="a2v">
You see, Squires, what you are to prepare for as 
Adventurers, or by way of Barter, if you think to 
Traffick here, and to carry the Fair One, especially if
she be at her own disposal (or being come some 
considerable time out of the Country) has been ini&shy;
tiated into the Conversation of the Town: The Re&shy;
fined Lady expects her Servants and humble Admirers 
should Court her in the Forms and Decencies of making 
Love in Fashion: In order to this, you must often 
Treat her at the Play, the Park, and the Musick;
present her at the Raffle, follow her to Tunbridge at 
the season of drinking of Waters, though you have no 
need of them your self: You must improve all occa&shy;
sions of celebrating her Shape, and how well the 
Mode becomes her, though it be ne'er so Fantastical 
and Ridiculous; that she Sings like an Angel, Dances 
like a Goddess; and that you are Charm'd with her 
Wit and Beauty: Above all, you must be sure to find 
some Fault or Imperfection in all other Ladies of the 
Town, and to laugh at the Fopps like your self: With 
this, a little Practice will qualifie you for the Conver&shy;
sation and Mistery of the Ruelle; and if the whole 
Morning be spent between the Glass and the Comb, 
that your Perruque fit well, and Cravat-Strings be 
adjusted as things of importance; with these and the 
like accomplishments you'l emerge a consummate Beau, 
Anglice, a Coxcomb. But the Dancing-Master will 
still be necessary to preserve your good Meen, and fit
you for the Winter-Ball.

Thus you see, young Sparks, how the Stile and Me&shy;
thod of Wooing is quite changed, as well as the Lan&shy;
guage, since the days of our Fore-Fathers (of unhappy 
</page>

<page sig="a3r">
Memory, simple and plain Men as they were) who 
Courted and chose their Wives for their Modesty, Fru&shy;
gality, keeping at Home, Good-Housewifery, and other 
Oeconomical Virutes then in Reputation: and when the 
young Damsels were taught all these in the Country, 
and their Parents Houses, the Portion they brought 
was more in Virtue than Money, and she was a richer 
Match than one who could have brought a Million, 
and nothing else to commend her. The Presents which 
were made when all was concluded, were a Ring, a 
Necklace of Pearl, and perhaps another fair Jewel, 
the <term lang="la">Bona Parphernalia</term> of her prudent Mother, whose 
Nuptial Kirtle, Gown and Petticoat lasted as many An&shy;
niversaries as the happy Couple liv'd together, and 
were at last bequeathed with a Purse of old Gold, Rose-&shy;
Nobles, Spur Royals, and Spankers, as an House-Loom 
to her Grand-Daughter.

They had Cupboards of Ancient, Useful Plate, whole 
Chests of Damask for the Table, and store of fine 
Holland Sheets (white as the driven Snow) and fra&shy;
grant of Rose and Lavender for the Bed; and the 
sturdy Oaken Bedstead, and Furniture of the House, 
lasted one whole Century; the Shovel-Board, and o&shy;
ther long Tables both in Hall and Parlour were as fix&shy;
ed as the Freehold; nothing was moveable save Joynt-&shy;
Stools, the Black Jacks, Silver Tankards, and Bowls: 
And though many things fell out between the Cup and the 
Lip, when Nappy Ale, March Beer, Metheglin, Malme&shy;
sey, and Old Sherry, got the Ascendant amongst the 
Blew-Coats, and Badges, they sung Old Symon, and
Cheviot-Chase, and danc'd brave Arthur, and were able 
to draw a Bow, that made the proud Monsieur Trem&shy;
</page>

<page sig="a3v">
ble at the Whizze of the Grey-Goose-Feather: 'Twas then 
Ancient Hospitality was kept up in Town and Country, 
by which the Tenants were enabled to pay their Landlords
at punctual day: The Poor were Relieved bountifully, and 
Charity was as warm as the Kitchin, where the Fire 
was perpetual. 

In those happy days, Sure-Foot, the Grave and steady 
Mare, carried the Good Knight, and his Courteous Lady 
behind him to Church, and to visit the Neighbourhood, 
without so many Hell-Carts, Ratling Coaches, and a crue 
of Damme Lacqueys, which a Grave Livery Servant 
or two supply'd, who Rid before and made way for his 
Worship.

Things of Use were Natural, Plain, and Wholesome 
nothing was superfluous, nothing necessary wanting: and 
Men of Estate studied the Publick Good and gave Ex&shy;
ample of true Piety, Loyalty, Justice, Sobriety, Chari&shy;
ty, and the good Neighborhood compos'd most differences: 
Perjury, Suborning Witnesses, Alimony, Avowed Adul&shy;
teries, and Misses (publickly own'd) were Prodigies in 
those days, and Laws were Reason, not Craft, when
Mens Titles were secure, and they served their Generation 
with Honour; left their Patrimonial Estates improv'd, to 
an Hopeful Heir, who passing from the Free-School to the 
Colledge, and thence to the Inns of Court, acquainting him&shy;
self with a competent Tincture of the Laws of his Country, 
followed the Example of his Worthy Ancestors; and if he 
Travell'd abroad, it was not to count Steeples, and bring 
home Feather and Ribbon, and the Sins of other Na&shy;
tions; but to gain such Experience as rendred him use&shy;
ful to his Prince and Country upon occasion, and confirm'd 
him in the Love of both of 'em above any other.

<page sig="a4r">
The Virgins and Young Ladies of that Golden Age, 
<term lang="la">Qu&aelig;sierunt lanam &amp; linum</term>; put their hands to the 
Spindle, nor disdain'd they the Needle; were obsequious, 
and helpful to their Parents; instructed in the Managery 
of the Family, and gave Presages of making excellent 
Wives; nor then did they Read so many Romances, see 
so many Plays, and smutty Farces; set up for Visits, and 
have their days of Audience, and Idle pass-time. Honest 
Gleek, Ruff and Honours, diverted the Ladies at 
Christmas, and they knew not so much as the Names 
of Ombre, Comet, and Basset. Their Retirements were 
Devout and Religious Books, and their Recreations in the
Distillatory, the knowledge of Plants and their Virtues, 
for the comfort of their poor Neighbours, and use of the 
Family, which wholsome plain Dyet, and Kitching Phy&shy;
sick, preserved in perfect Health: In those days, the
Scurvy, Spleen, &amp;c. were scarce heard of, till Foreign 
Drinks and Mixtures were wantonly introduc'd. Nor 
were the young Gentlewomen so universally afflicted with 
Hysterical Fits; nor, though extreamly modest, at all
Melancholy, or less Gay, and in good Humour; they could 
touch the Lute, and Virginal, sing like to the Damask 
Rose ------ and their Breath was as sweet as their Voi&shy;
ces: They danc'd the Canarys' Spanish Pavan, and Se&shy;
lengers Round upon Sippets, with as much Grace and 
Loveliness, as any Isaac, Monsieur, or Italian of them 
all, can Teach with his Fop-call, and Apish Postures.

To shew you then, how the World is alter'd among us, 
since Foreign Manners, the Luxury (more than Asiatick, 
which was the final Ruine of the Greatest, Wisest, and 
most Noble Monarchy upon Earth) has universally ob&shy;
tain'd among us, corrupting ancient simplicity; and in

To conclude, Those who have the curiosity, by 
comparing these Terms with the Ancients, thereby 
to inform themselves, how this Elegant Science is
improv'd, especially since we have submitted to, 
and still continue under the Empire of the French, 
(for want of some Royal or Illustrious Ladies Inven&shy;
tion and Courage, to give the Law of the Mode 
to her own Country, and to Vindicate it from Fo&shy;
reign Tyranny) may for Divine History consult 
Isaiah 6th ch. ver. 16, &amp;c. and for Prophane, read 
Plautus his <term lang="la">Poenulus</term>, Act. I. Scen. 2. and his <term lang="la">Auluaria</term>, 
Act. 3. Scen. 5.
