SPeach is not naturall to man sauing for his onely habilitie to 
speake, and that he is by kinde apt to vtter all his conceits with 
sounds and voyces diuersified many maner of wayes, by meanes 
of the many &amp; fit instruments he hath by nature to that purpose, 
as a broad and voluble tong, thinne and mouable lippes, teeth eu<expan type="e+_">en</expan>
and not shagged, thick ranged, a round vaulted pallate, and a long 
throte, besides an excellent capacitie of wit that maketh him more 
disciplinable and imitatiue then any other creature: then as to the
</page>
<page no="120">
forme and action of his speach, it commeth to him by arte &amp;  tea&shy;
ching, and by vse or exercise. But after a speach is fully fashioned 
to the common vnderstanding, &amp;  accepted by consent of a whole 
countrey &amp;  nati<expan type="o+_">on</expan>, it is called a language, &amp;  receaueth none allow&shy;
ed alteration, but by extraordinary occasions by little &amp; little, as it 
were insensibly bringing in of many corrupti<expan type+"o+_">on</expan>s that creepe along 
with the time: of all which matters, we haue more largely spoken 
in our bookes of the originals and pedigree of the English tong. 
Then when I say language, I meane the speach wherein the Poet 
or maker writeth be it Greek or Latine, or as our case is the vulgar 
English, &amp; when it is peculiar vnto a countrey it is called the mo&shy;
ther speach of that people: the Greekes terme it <term lang="gkt">Idioma</term>: so is ours 
at this day the Norman English. Before the Conquest of the Nor&shy;
mans it was the Anglesaxon, and before that the British, which as 
some will, is at this day, the Walsh, or as others affirme the Cor&shy;
nish: I for my part thinke neither of both, as they be now spoken 
and pronounced. This part in our maker or Poet must be heedy&shy;
ly looked vnto, that it be naturall, pure, and the most vsuall of all 
his countrey: and for the same purpose rather that which is spo&shy;
ken in the kings Court, or in the good townes and Cities within 
the land, then in the marches and frontiers, or in port townes, 
where straungers haunt for traffike sake, or yet in Vniuersities 
where Schollers vse much peeuish affectation of words out of the 
primatiue languages, or finally, in any vplandish village or cor&shy;
ner of a Realme, where is no resort but of poore rusticall or vnci&shy;
uill people: neither shall he follow the speach of a craftes man or 
carter, or other of the inferiour sort, though he be inhabitant or 
bred in the best towne and Citie in this Realme, for such persons 
doe abuse good speaches by strange accents or ill shapen soundes, 
and false ortographie. But he shall follow generally the better 
brought vp sort, such as the Greekes call [<term lang="gkt">charientes</term>] men ciuill 
and graciously behauoured and bred. Our maker therfore at these 
dayes shall not follow <f type="i">Piers plowman</f> nor <f type="i">Gower</f> nor <f type="i">Lydgate</f> nor 
yet <f type="i">Chaucer</f>, for their language is now out of vse with vs: neither 
shall he take the termes of Northern-men, such as they vse in day&shy;

clarkes all is a matter: nor in effect any speach vsed beyond the

riuer of Trent, though no man can deny but that theirs is the pu&shy;
rer English Saxon at this day, yet it is not so Courtly nor so cur&shy;
rant as our Southerne English is, no more is the far Westerne m<expan type="a+_">an</expan>s 
speach: ye shall therfore take the vsuall speach of the Court, and 
that of London and the shires lying about London within lx. 
myles, and not much aboue. I say not this but that in euery shyre 
of England there be gentlemen and others that speake but special&shy;
ly write as good Southerne as we of Middlesex or Surrey do, but 
not the common people of euery shire, to whom the gentlemen, 
and also their learned clarkes do for the most part condescend, but 
herein we are already ruled by th'English Dictionaries and other 
bookes written by learned men, and therefore it needeth none o&shy;
ther direction in that behalfe. Albeit peraduenture some small ad&shy;
monition be not impertinent, for we finde in our English wri&shy;
ters many wordes and speaches amendable, &amp; ye shall see in some 
many inkhorne termes so ill affected brought in by men of lear&shy;
ning as preachers and schoolemasters: and many straunge termes 
of other languages by Secretaries and Marchaunts and trauai&shy;
lours, and many darke wordes and not vsuall nor well sounding, 
though they be dayly spoken in Court. Wherefore great heed 
must be taken by our maker in this point that his choise be good. 
And peraduenture the writer hereof be in that behalfe no lesse 
faultie then any other, vsing many straunge and vnaccusto&shy;
med wordes and borrowed from other languages: and in that 
respect him selfe no meete Magistrate to reforme the same 
errours in any other person, but since he is not vnwilling to 
acknowledge his owne fault, and can the better tell how to 
amend it, he may seeme a more excusable correctour of other 
mens: he intendeth therefore for an indifferent way and vni&shy;
uersall benefite to taxe him selfe first and before any others.

<f type="i">Of the figures which we call Sensable, because they alter 
and affect the minde by alteration of sence, 
and first in single wordes.</f>
<wordgroup1 type="t"><alpha object="Sensible figures"></alpha>

<wordentry type="g"><form lang="gkt"><f type="i">Metaphora</f>,
</form> <xpln lexeme="figure of transport(n)" lang="en">or the 
Figure of tran&shy;
sporte. 
THe eare hauing receiued his due satisfaction by the <f type="i">auricular</f> 
figures, now must the minde also be serued, with his naturall 
delight by figures <f type="i">sensible</f> such as by alteration of intendmentes 
affect the courage, and geue a good liking to the conceit. And 
first, single words haue their sence and vnderstanding altered and 
figured many wayes, to wit, by transport, abuse, crosse-naming, 
new naming, change of name. This will seeme very darke to you, 
vnlesse it be otherwise explaned more particularly: and first of 
<f type="i">Transport.</f> There is a kinde of wresting of a single word from his 
owne right signification, to another not so naturall, but yet of 
some affinitie or conueniencie with it, as to say, <f type="i">I cannot digest your 
vnkinde words,</f> for I cannot take them in good part: or as the man 
of law said, <f type="i">I feele you not,</f> for I vnderstand not your case, because he 
had not his fee in his hand. Or as another said to a mouthy Aduo&shy;
cate, <f type="i">why barkest thou at me so sore?</f> Or to call the top of a tree, or of 
a hill, the crowne of a tree or of a hill: for in deede <f type="i">crowne</f> is the 
highest ornament of a Princes head, made like a close garland, or 
els the top of a mans head, where the haire windes about, and be&shy;
cause such terme is not applyed naturally to a tree, or to a hill, but 
</page>
<page no="149">
is transported from a mans head to a hill or tree, therefore it is 
called by <f type="i">metaphore,</f> or the figure of <f type="i">transport.</f> And three causes 
moues vs to vse this figure, one for necessitie or want of a better 
word, thus: 

<f type="i">As the drie ground that thirstes after a showr 
Seemes to reioyce when it is well iwet, 
And speedely brings foorth both grasse and flowr, 
If lacke of sunne or season doo not let.</f>

Here for want of an apter and more naturall word to declare 
the drie temper of the earth, it is said to thirst &amp; to reioyce, which 
is onely proper to liuing creatures, and yet being so inuerted, doth 
not so much swerue from the true sence, but that euery man can 
easilie conceiue the meaning thereof.

Againe, we vse it for pleasure and ornament of our speach, as 
thus in an Epitaph of our owne making, to the honourable me&shy;
morie of a deere friend, Sir <f type="i">Iohn Throgmorton,</f> knight, Iustice of 
Chester, and a man of many commendable vertues.

<f type="i">Whom vertue rerde, enuy hath ouerthrowen 
And lodged full low, vnder this marble stone: 
Ne neuer were his values so well knowen, 
Whilest he liued here, as now that he is gone.</f> 

Here these words, <f type="i">rered, ouerthrowen,</f> and <f type="i">lodged,</f> are inuerted, &amp; 
<f type="i">metaphorically</f> applyed, not vpon necessitie, but for ornament one&shy;
ly, afterward againe in these verses.

<f type="i">No sunne by day that euer saw him rest 
Free from the toyles of his so busie charge, 
No night that harbourd rankor in his breast, 
Nor merry moode, made reason runne at large.</f> 

In these verses the inuersion or metaphore, lyeth in these words, 
<f type="i">saw, harbourd, run:</f> which naturally are applyed to liuing things, 
&amp; not to insensible: as, the <f type="i">sunne,</f> or the <f type="i">night:</f> &amp; yet they approch so 
neere, &amp; so c<expan type="o+_">on</expan>ueniently, as the speech is thereby made more com&shy;
mendable. Againe, in moe verses of the same Epitaph, thus.

<f type="i">His head a source of grauitie and sence, 
His memory a shop of ciuill arte: 
His tongue a streame of sugred eloquence, 
Wisdome and meekenes lay mingled in his harte,</f>
</page>
<page no="150">
In which verses ye see that these words, <f type="i">source, shop, flud, sugred,</f> 
are inuerted from their owne signification to another, not altoge&shy;
ther so naturall, but of much affinitie with it. 

Then also do we it sometimes to enforce a sence and make the 
word more significatiue: as thus, 

<f type="i">I burne in loue, I freese in deadly hate 
I swimme in hope, and sinke in deepe dispaire.</f>

These examples I haue the willinger giu<expan type="e+_">en</expan> you to set foorth the 
nature and vse of your figure metaphore, which of any other be&shy;
ing choisly made, is the most commendable and most common.</xpln><lemenote>The transliterated Greek headword and the English translation that begins the explanation both appear in the margin. "metaphora" is not in the OED as an English term.</lemenote></wordentry>

<wordentry type="g"><form lang="gkt"><f type="i">Catachresis</f>,
</form> <xpln lexeme="figure of abuse(n)" lang="en">or the 
Figure of abuse 
But if for lacke of naturall and proper terme or worde we take 
another, neither naturall nor proper and do vntruly applie it to 
the thing which we would seeme to expresse, and without any 
iust inconuenience, it is not then spoken by this figure <f type="i">Metaphore</f> 
or of <f type="i">inuersion</f> as before, but by plaine abuse, as he that bad his man 
go into his library and fet him his bowe and arrowes, for in deede

perly the hunters terme giuen to young deere, leane &amp; out of sea&shy;
son, and not to people: or as one said very pretily in this verse. 

<f type="i">I lent my loue to losse, and gaged my life in vaine.</f> 

Whereas this worde <f type="i">lent</f> is properly of mony or some such o&shy;
ther thing, as men do commonly borrow, for vse to be repayed a&shy;
gaine, and being applied to loue is vtterly abused, and yet very 
commendably spoken by vertue of this figure. For he that loueth 
and is not beloued againe, hath no lesse wrong, than he that len&shy;

</form> <xpln lexeme="misnamer(n)" lang="en">or the 
Misnamer. 
Now doth this vnderstanding or secret conceyt reach many 
times to the only nomination of persons or things in their names, 
as of men, or mountaines, seas, countries and such like, in which re&shy;
spect the wr<expan type="o+_">on</expan>g naming, or otherwise naming of them then is due, 
carieth not onely an alteration of sence but a necessitie of intend&shy;
ment figuratiuely, as when we cal loue by the name of <f type="i">Venus,</f> flesh&shy;
ly lust by the name of <f type="i">Cupid,</f> bicause they were supposed by the 
auncient poets to be authors and kindlers of loue and lust: <f type="i">Vul&shy;
cane</f> for fire, <f type="i">Ceres</f> for bread: <f type="i">Bacchus</f> for wine by the same rea&shy;
son; also if one should say to a skilfull craftesman knowen for a

<page no="151">
glutton or common drunkard, that had spent all his goods on riot 
and delicate fare. 

<f type="i">Thy hands they made thee rich, thy pallat made thee poore.</f> 

It is ment, his trauaile and arte made him wealthie, his riotous 
life had made him a beggar: and as one that boasted of his house&shy;
keeping, said that neuer a yeare passed ouer his head, that he drank 
not in his house euery moneth foure tonnes of beere, &amp; one hogs&shy;
head of wine, meaning not the caskes or vessels, but that quantitie 
which they conteyned. These and such other speaches, where ye 
take the name of the Author for the thing it selfe; or the thing c<expan type="o+_">on</expan>&shy;
teining, for that which is contained, &amp; in many other cases do as it 
were wrong name the person or the thing. So neuerthelesse as it 
may be vnderstood, it is by the figure <f type="i"><term lang="gkt">metonymia</term>,</f> or misnamer.</xpln><lemenote>The transliterated Greek headword and the English translation that begins the explanation both appear in the margin.

And if this manner of naming of persons or things be not by 
way of misnaming as before, but by a conuenient difference, and 
such as is true or esteemed and likely to be true, it is then called 
not <f type="i"><term lang="gkt">metonimia</term>,</f> but <f type="i"><term lang="gkt">antonomasia</term>,</f> or the Surnamer, (not the misna&shy;
mer, which might extend to any other thing aswell as to a person) 
as he that would say: not king Philip of Spaine, but the Westerne 
king, because his domini<expan type="o+_">on</expan> lieth the furdest West of any Christen 
prince: and the French king the great <f type="i">Vallois,</f> because so is the 
name of his house, or the Queene of England, <f type="i">The maiden Queene,</f> 
for that is her hiest peculiar among all the Queenes of the 
world, or as we said in one of our <f type="i">Partheniades,</f> the <f type="i">Bryton mayde,</f> 
because she is the most great and famous mayden of all Brittayne: 
thus, 

<f type="i">But in chaste stile, am borne as I weene

as to say: <f type="i">flashing of lightning, clashing of blades, clinking of fetters, 
chinking of mony:</f> &amp; as the poet <f type="i">Virgil</f> said of the sounding a trum&shy;

said: <f type="i">darke disdaine,</f> and <f type="i">miserable pride,</f> very absurdly, for disdaine

cleere, because they be beholden and much looked vpon, and pride 
is rather enuied then pitied or miserable, vnlesse it be in Christian 
charitie, which helpeth not the terme in this case. Some of our vul&shy;
gar writers take great pleasure in giuing Epithets and do it almost 
to euery word which may receiue them, and should not be so, yea 
though they were neuer so propre and apt, for sometimes wordes

we vse to say by manner of Prouerbe: things farrefet and deare 
bought are good for Ladies: so in this manner of speach we vse it, 
leaping ouer the heads of a great many words, we take one that is 
furdest off, to vtter our matter by: as <f type="i">Medea</f> cursing hir first ac&shy;

and [<f type="i">hauen</f>] peace, this is spoken all in allegorie: and because such 
inuersion of sence in one single worde is by the figure <f type="i">Metaphore,</f> 
of whom we spake before, and this manner of inuersion exten&shy;
ding to whole and large speaches, it maketh the figure <f type="i">allegorie</f> to 
be called a long and perpetuall Metaphore. A noble man after a 
whole yeares absence from his ladie, sent to know how she did, and 
whether she remayned affected toward him as she was when he 
left her. 

<f type="i">Louely Lady I long full sore to heare, 
If ye remaine the same, I left you the last yeare.</f> 

To whom she answered in <f type="i">allegorie</f> other two verses: 

<f type="i">My louing Lorde I will well that ye wist, 
The thred is spon, that neuer shall vntwist.</f> 

Meaning, that her loue was so stedfast and c<expan type="o+_">on</expan>stant toward him 
as no time or occasion could alter it. <f type="i">Virgill</f> in his shepeherdly 
poemes called <f type="i">Eglogues</f> vsed as rusticall but fit <f type="i">allegorie</f> for the

<f type="i"><term lang="la">Claudite iam riuos pueri sat prata biberunt.</term></f> 

Which I English thus: 

<f type="i">Stop vp your streames (my lads) the medes haue drunk ther fill.</f> 

As much to say, leaue of now, yee haue talked of the matter 
inough: for the shepheards guise in many places is by opening cer&shy;
taine sluces to water their pastures, so as when they are wet inough 
they shut them againe: this application is full Allegoricke.

Ye haue another manner of Allegorie not full, but mixt, as he 
that wrate thus: 

<f type="i">The cloudes of care haue coured all my coste, 
The stormes of strife, do threaten to appeare: 
The waues of woe, wherein my ship is toste. 
Haue broke the banks, where lay my life so deere. 
Chippes of ill chance, are fallen amidst my choise, 
To marre the minde that ment for to reioyce.</f> 

I call him not a full Allegorie, but mixt, bicause he discouers 
withall what the <f type="i">cloud, storme, waue,</f> and the rest are, which in a full 
allegorie should not be discouered, but left at large to the readers 
iudgement and coniecture.</xpln><lemenote>The transliterated Greek headword and the English translation that begins the explanation both appear in the margin. "allegoria" is not in the OED as an English term.</lemenote></wordentry>

What should I go about to recite your Maiesties innumerable

Then haue ye the figure <f type="i"><term lang="gkt">Periphrasis</term>,</f> holding somewhat of the

as when we go about the bush, and will not in one or a few words 
expresse that thing which we desire to haue knowen, but do chose 
rather to do it by many words, as we our selues wrote of our Soue&shy;

<f type="i">Whom Princes serue, and Realmes obay, 
And greatest of Bryton kings begot: 
She came abroade euen yesterday,

And the rest that followeth, meaning her Maiesties person, 
which we would seeme to hide leauing her name vnspoken, to the 
intent the reader should gesse at it: neuerthelesse vpon the matter 
did so manifestly disclose it, as any simple iudgement might easily 
perceiue by whom it was ment, that is by Lady <f type="i">Elizabeth, Queene 
of England and daughter to king Henry the eight,</f> and therein resteth 
the dissimulation. It is one of the gallantest figures among the 
poetes so it be vsed discretely and in his right kinde, but many of 
these makers that be not halfe their craftes maisters, do very often 
abuse it and also many waies. For if the thing or person they go 
about to describe by circumstance, be by the writers improuidence 
otherwise bewrayed, it looseth the grace of a figure, as he that said: 

<f type="i">The tenth of March when Aries receiued, 
Dan Ph&oelig;bus raies into his horned hed.</f> 

Intending to describe the spring of the yeare, which euery man 
knoweth of himselfe, hearing the day of March named: the verses 
be very good the figure nought worth, if it were meant in Peri&shy;
phrase, for the matter, that is the season of the yeare which should 
haue bene couertly disclosed by ambage, was by and by blabbed 
out by naming the day of the moneth, &amp; so the purpose of the fi&shy;
gure disapointed, peraduenture it had bin better to haue said thus: 
</page>
<page no="162">
<f type="i">The month and daie when Aries receiud, 
Dan Ph&oelig;bus raies into his horned head.</f> 

For now there remaineth for the Reader somewhat to studie 
and gesse vpon, and yet the spring time to the learned iudgement 
sufficiently expressed.

The Noble Earle of Surrey wrote thus: 

<f type="i">In winters iust returne, when Boreas gan his raigne, 
And euery tree vnclothed him fast as nature taught th<expan type="e+_">em</expan> plaine.</f> 

I would faine learne of some good maker, whether the Earle 
spake this in figure of <f type="i"><term lang="gkt">Periphrase</term></f> or not, for mine owne opinion I 
thinke that if he ment to describe the winter season, he would not 
haue disclosed it so broadly, as to say winter at the first worde, for 
that had bene against the rules of arte, and without any good 
iudgement: which in so learned &amp; excellent a personage we ought 
not to suspect, we say therefore that for winter it is no <f type="i">Periphrase</f> 
but language at large: we say for all that, hauing regard to the se&shy;
cond verse that followeth it is a <f type="i"><term lang="gkt">Periphrase</term>,</f> seeming that thereby 
he intended to shew in what part of the winter his loues gaue him 
anguish, that is in the time which we call the fall of the leafe, which 
begins in the moneth of October, and stands very well with the 
figure to be vttered in that sort notwithstanding winter be named 
before, for winter hath many parts: such namely as do not shake 
of the leafe, nor vncloth the trees as here is mencioned: thus may 
ye iudge as I do, that this noble Erle wrate excellently well and to 
purpose. Moreouer, when a maker will seeme to vse circumlocu&shy;
tion to set forth any thing pleasantly and figuratiuely, yet no lesse 
plaine to a ripe reader, then if it were named expresly, and when all 
is done, no man can perceyue it to be the thing intended. This is a 
foule ouersight in any writer as did a good fellow, who weening 
to shew his cunning, would needs by periphrase expresse the 
realme of Scotland in no lesse then eight verses, and when he had 
said all, no man could imagine it to be spoken of Scotland: and

NOw if our presupposall be true, that the Poet is of all other 
the most auncient Orator, as he that by good &amp; pleasant per&shy;
swasions first reduced the wilde and beastly people into publicke 
societies and ciuilitie of life, insinuating vnto them, vnder fictions 
with sweete and coloured speeches, many wholesome lessons and 
doctrines, then no doubt there is nothing so fitte for him, as to 
be furnished with all the figures that be <f type="i">Rhetoricall,</f> and such as do 
most beautifie language with eloquence &amp; sententiousnes. Ther&shy;
fore, since we haue already allowed to our maker his <f type="i">auricular</f> fi&shy;
gures, and also his <f type="i">sensable,</f> by which all the words and clauses of 
his meeters are made as well tunable to the eare, as stirring to the 
minde, we are now by order to bestow vpon him those other fi&shy;
gures which may execute both offices, and all at once to beautifie 
and geue sence and sententiousnes to the whole language at large. 
So as if we should intreate our maker to play also the Orator, and 
</page>
<page no="164">
whether it be to pleade, or to praise, or to aduise, that in all three 
cases he may vtter, and also perswade both copiously and vehe&shy;
mently. 

And your figures rhethoricall, besides their remembred ordi&shy;
narie vertues, that is, sent<expan type="e+_">en</expan>tiousnes, &amp; copious amplification, or en&shy;
largement of language, doe also conteine a certaine sweet and me&shy;
lodious manner of speech, in which respect, they may, after a sort, 
be said <f type="i">auricular:</f> because the eare is no lesse rauished with their 
currant tune, than the mind is with their sententiousnes. For the 
eare is properly but an instrument of conueyance for the minde, 
to apprehend the sence by the sound. And our speech is made me&shy;
lodious or harmonicall, not onely by strayned tunes, as those of 
<f type="i">Musick,</f> but also by choise of smoothe words: and thus, or thus, 
marshalling them in their comeliest construction and order, and 
aswell by sometimes sparing, sometimes spending them more or 
lesse liberally, and carrying or transporting of them farther off or 
neerer, setting them with sundry relations, and variable formes, 
in the ministery and vse of words, doe breede no little alteration 
in man. For to say truely, what els is man but his minde? which, 
whosoeuer haue skil to compasse, and make yeelding and flexible, 
what may not he commaund the body to perfourme? He there&shy;
fore that hath vanquished the minde of man, hath made the grea&shy;
test and most glorious conquest. But the minde is not assailable 
vnlesse it be by sensible approches, whereof the audible is of grea&shy;
test force for instruction or discipline: the visible, for apprehension 
of exterior knowledges as the Philosopher saith. Therefore the 
well tuning of your words and clauses to the delight of the eare, 
maketh your information no lesse plausible to the minde than to 
the eare: no though you filled them with neuer so much sence and 
sententiousnes. Then also must the whole tale (if it tende to per&shy;
swasion) beare his iust and reasonable measure, being rather with 
the largest, than with the scarcest. For like as one or two drops of 
water perce not the flint stone, but many and often droppings 
doo: so cannot a few words (be they neuer so pithie or sententi&shy;
ous) in all cases and to all manner of mindes, make so deepe an im&shy;
pression, as a more multitude of words to the purpose discreetely, 
and without superfluitie vttered: the minde being no lesse vanqui&shy;

burden. Sweetenes of speech, sentence, and amplification, are ther&shy;
fore necessarie to an excellent Orator and Poet, ne may in no wise 
be spared from any of them. 

And first of all others your figure that worketh by iteration or 
repetition of one word or clause doth much alter and affect the 
eare and also the mynde of the hearer, and therefore is counted 
a very braue figure both with the Poets and rhetoriciens, and this

ye may see the difference betwixt the figures <f type="i"><term lang="gkt">Antonomasia</term></f> &amp; <f type="i">Pro&shy;

of another nature, and not vpon mens names, yet doeth the Poet 
or maker finde prety sport to play with them in his verse, special&shy;

To till it is a toyle, to grase some honest gaine, 
But such as gotten is with great hazard and paine:

A shrewd wife brings thee bate, wiue not and neuer thriue, 
Children a charge, childlesse the greatest lacke aliue: 
Youth witlesse is and fraile, age sicklie and forlorne, 
Then better to dye soone, or neuer to be borne.</f> 

<f type="i">Metrodorus</f> the Philosopher <f type="i">Stoick</f> was of a contrary opinion

The solemne vowes oft sworne with teares so salt, 
And holy Leagues fast seald with hand and hart: 
For to repeale and breake so wilfully? 
But now (alas) without all iust desart, 
My lot is for my troth and much good will, 
To reape disdaine, hatred and rude refuse, 
Or if ye would worke me some greater ill: 
And of myne earned ioyes to feele no part, 
What els is this (&ocirc; cruell) but to vse, 
Thy murdring knife the guiltlesse bloud to spill.</f> 

Where ye see how she is charged first with a fault, then with a 
<emend err="a"></emend> secret sinne, afterward with a foule forfet, last of all with a most 
cruell &amp; bloudy deede. And thus againe in a certaine louers com&shy;

<f type="i">They say it is a ruth to see thy louer neede,</f>

And gaspe and grone for life, and struggle still with death, 
What can you now do more; sweare by your maydenhead, 
Then for to flea me quicke, or strip me being dead.</f> 

In these verses you see how one crueltie surmounts another by 
degrees till it come to very slaughter and beyond, for it is thought

a notorious vnthrift, a lustie youth, and such like phrases of exte&shy;

And we vse the like termes by way of pleasant familiaritie, and 
as it were for a Courtly maner of speach with our egalls or inferi&shy;

But when we liken an humane person to another in counte&shy;

the painters terme, who yeldeth to th'eye a visible representati<expan type="o+_">on</expan> of

Finally, if in matter of counsell or perswasion we will seeme to 
liken one case to another, such as passe ordinarily in mans affaires, 
and doe compare the past with the present, gathering probabili&shy;
tie of like successe to come in the things wee haue presently in

zed by antiquitie as veritable, and peraduenture fayned and ima&shy;
gined for some purpose, into similitude or dissimilitude with our 
present actions and affaires, it is called resemblance by example: as 
if one should say thus, <f type="i">Alexander</f> the great in his expedition to 
Asia did thus, so did <f type="i">Hanniball</f> comming into Spaine, so did <f type="i">C&aelig;sar</f> 
</page>
<page no="206">
in Egypt, therfore all great Captains &amp; Generals ought to doe it. 

And consulting vpon the affaires of the low countreis at this
day, peraduenture her Maiestie might be thus aduised: The Fle&shy;
mings are a people very vnthankfull and mutable, and rebellious
against their Princes, for they did rise against <f type="i">Maximilian</f> Arch&shy;
duke of Austria, who had maried the daughter and heire of the
house of Burgundie, and tooke him prisoner, till by the Emperour
<f type="i">Frederike</f> the third his father, he was set at libertie. They rebelled
against <f type="i">Charles</f> the fift Emperor, their naturall Prince. They haue
falsed their faith to his sonne <f type="i">Philip</f> king of Spaine their soveraign
Lord: and since to Archduke <f type="i">Matthias</f>, whom they elected for
their gouernor, after to their adopted Lord Monsieur of Fraunce,
Duke of Amou: I pray you what likelihood is there they should
be more assured to the Queene of England, than they haue bene to
all these princes and gouernors, l<expan type="o+_">on</expan>ger than their distresse continu&shy;
eth, and is to be relieued by her goodnes and puissance.

And as this resemblance is of one mans action to another, so 
may it be made by examples of bruite beastes, aptly correspon&shy;
ding in qualitie or euent, as one that wrote certaine prety verses 
of the Emperor <f type="i">Maximinus,</f> to warne him that he should not glo&shy;
ry too much in his owne strength, for so he did in very deede, and 
would take any common souldier to taske at wrastling, or wea&shy;
pon, or in any other actiuitie and feates of armes, which was by the 
wiser sort misliked, these were the verses.

<f type="i">The Elephant is strong, yet death doeth it subdue, 
The bull is strong, yet cannot death eschue. 
The Lion strong, and slaine for all his strength: 
The Tygar strong, yet kilde is at the length. 
Dread thou many, that dreadest not any one, 
Many can kill, that cannot kill alone.</f> 

And so it fell out, for <f type="i">Maximinus</f> was slaine in a mutinie of his 
souldiers, taking no warning by these examples, written for his 
admonition.</xpln><lemenote>The transliterated Greek headword and the English translation that begins the explanation both appear in the margin. "paradigma" is in the OED as an English term.</lemenote></wordentry>

<f type="i">Of the vices or deformities in speach and writing

IT hath bene said before how by ignorance of the maker a good 
figure may become a vice, and by his good discretion, a vicious 
speach go for a vertue in the Poeticall science. This saying is to 
be explaned and qualified, for some maner of speaches are al&shy;
wayes intollerable and such as cannot be vsed with any decencie, 
but are euer vndecent namely barbarousnesse, incongruitie, ill dis&shy;
position, fond affectation, rusticitie, and all extreme darknesse, such 
as it is not possible for a man to vnderstand the matter without an 
interpretour, all which partes are generally to be banished out of 
euery language, vnlesse it may appeare that the maker or Poet do 
it for the nonce, as it was reported by the Philosopher <f type="i">Heraclitus</f> 
that he wrote in obscure and darke termes of purpose not to be 
vnderstood, whence he merited the nickname <f type="i">Scotinus,</f> otherwise 
I see not but the rest of the common faultes may be borne with

<page no="209">
sometimes, or passe without any great reproofe, not being vsed 
ouermuch or out of season as I said before: so as euery surplusage 
or preposterous placing or vndue iteration or darke word, or 
doubtfull speach are not so narrowly to be looked vpon in a large 
poeme, nor specially in the pretie Poesies and deuises of Ladies, 
and Gentlewomen makers, whom we would not haue too precise 
Poets least with their shrewd wits, when they were maried they 
might become a little too phantasticall wiues, neuerthelesse be&shy;
cause we seem to promise an arte, which doth not iustly admit any 
wilful errour in the teacher, and to th'end we may not be carped at 
by these methodicall men, that we haue omitted any necessary 
point in this businesse to be regarded, I will speake somewhat 
touching these viciosities of language particularly and brief&shy;
ly, leauing no little to the Grammarians for maintenaunce of the

First, the whole matter is not worth all this solemne circum&shy;

that the sence may be taken two wayes, such ambiguous termes 
they call <f type="i"><term lang="gkt">Amphibologia</term>,</f> we call it the <f type="i">ambiguous,</f> or figure of sence 
incertaine, as if one should say <f type="i">Thomas Tayler</f> saw <f type="i">William Tyler</f> 
dronke, it is indifferent to thinke either th'one or th'other dronke. 
Thus said a gentleman in our vulgar pretily notwithstanding be&shy;
cause he did it not ignorantly, but for the nonce. 

<f type="i">I sat by my Lady soundly sleeping, 
My mistresse lay by me bitterly weeping.</f> 

No man can tell by this, whether the mistresse or the man, slept 
or wept: these doubtfull speaches were vsed much in the old times 
by their false Prophets as appeareth by the Oracles of <f type="i">Delphos</f> and 
</page>
<page no="218">
and of the <f type="i">Sybilles</f> prophecies deuised by the religious persons of 
those dayes to abuse the superstitious people, and to encomber 
their busie braynes with vaine hope or vaine feare. 

<f type="i">Lucianus</f> the merry Greeke reciteth a great number of them, 
deuised by a coosening companion one <f type="i">Alexander,</f> to get himselfe 
the name and reputation of the God <f type="i">&AElig;sculapius,</f> and in effect all 
our old Brittish and Saxon prophesies be of the same sort, that 
turne them on which side ye will, the matter of them may be veri&shy;
fied, neuerthelesse carryeth generally such force in the heades of 
fonde people, that by the comfort of those blind prophecies many 
insurrections and rebellions haue bene stirred vp in this Realme, 
as that of <f type="i">Iacke Straw,</f> &amp; <f type="i">Iacke Cade</f> in <f type="i">Richard</f> the seconds time, 
and in our time by a seditious fellow in Norffolke calling himself 
Captaine Ket and others in other places of the Realme lead alto&shy;
gether by certaine propheticall rymes, which might be constred 
two or three wayes as well as to that one whereunto the rebelles 
applied it, our maker shall therefore auoyde all such ambiguous 
speaches vnlesse it be when he doth it for the nonce and for some 
purpose.</xpln><lemenote>The transliterated Greek headword and the English translation that begins the explanation both appear in the margin. "amphibologia" is not in the OED as an English term, but see "amphibology," n.</lemenote></wordentry>
